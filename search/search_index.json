You can see its usage in all the Piper steps, for example newmanExecute . Custom default configuration \u00b6 For projects that are composed of multiple repositories (microservices), it might be desired to provide custom default configurations. To do that, create a YAML file which is accessible from your CI/CD environment and configure it in your project configuration.

Note, the parameter customDefaults is required to be a list of strings and needs to be defined as a separate section of the project configuration. In addition, the item order in the list implies the precedence, i.e., the last item of the customDefaults list has highest precedence. It is important to ensure that the HTTP response body is proper YAML, as the pipeline will attempt to parse it. Anonymous read access to the custom-defaults repository is required.

The pipelines are centrally maintained and can be used with only a small amount of declarative configuration as documented here . For the vast majority of standard projects, the features of the ready-made pipelines should be enough to implement Continuous Delivery with little effort in a best-practice compliant way. If you miss a feature or discover a bug in one of our pipelines, please see if there is already an open issue in our GitHub repository and if not, open a new one. In some cases, it's not desirable to include specialized features in the ready-made pipelines. However, you can still benefit from their qualities, if you address your requirements through an extension . Extensions are custom bits of pipeline coding, which you can use to implement special requirements. This page explains extensibility options in project \"Piper\". For a high level overview of available options and how to interface with them, see this figure: Before building extensions, please make sure that there is no alternative that works better for you. Options for extensibility, in the order in which we recommend considering them: 1. Extend individual stages \u00b6 In this option, you use the centrally maintained pipeline but can change individual stages, if required. To do so, create a file called <StageName>.groovy (for example, Acceptance.groovy or lint.groovy ) in .pipeline/extensions/ in the source code repository of your application. For this, you need to know the technical identifiers for stage names. For the general purpose pipeline, you can find them in the pipeline source file . The centrally maintained pipeline checks if such a file exists and if it does, executes it. A parameter of type Map that contains the following keys is passed to the extension: script : Defines the global script environment of the Jenkinsfile run. This makes sure that the correct configuration environment can be passed to project \"Piper\" steps and allows access to the commonPipelineEnvironment , for example. When calling a piper step in an extension, the script object has to be passed using script: params.script . originalStage : Allows you to execute the \"original\" stage at any place in your script. If omitting a call to originalStage() , only your code is executed. stageName : Name of the current stage config : Configuration of the stage and general config (including all defaults) Here is a simple example for such an extension, which you can use as a starting point: void call ( Map params ) { //access stage name echo \"Start - Extension for stage: ${params.stageName}\" //access config echo \"Current stage config: ${params.config}\" //execute original stage as defined in the template params . originalStage () //access overall pipeline script object echo \"Branch: ${params.script.commonPipelineEnvironment.gitBranch}\" echo \"End - Extension for stage: ${params.stageName}\" } return this return this Don't forget the return this , which is required at the end of all extension scripts. This is due to how Groovy loads scripts internally. Init stage cannot be extended Please note that the Init stage also checks out your current repository including your extensions. Therefore, it is not possible to use extensions on this stage. Disable Extensions Execution By default, there is a possibility for extensions to get executed. In case of disabling it, please ensure to set PIPER_DISABLE_EXTENSIONS to true . Setting this parameter to true excludes the execution of extension files in .pipeline/extensions/<StageName>.groovy . Practical example \u00b6 For a more practical example, you can use extensions in the general purpose pipeline to add custom linters to your pipeline. A linter is a tool that can check the source code for certain stylistic criteria. Many teams choose to use a linter to ensure a common programming style. For example, if you want to use Checkstyle in your codebase, you might use an extension similar to this one in a file called .pipeline/extensions/Build.groovy in your project: def call ( Map parameters ) { parameters . originalStage () // Runs the build stage with built-in linters mavenExecute ( script: parameters . script , flags: [ '--batch-mode' ], pomPath: 'application/pom.xml' , m2Path: s4SdkGlobals . m2Directory , goals: [ 'checkstyle:checkstyle' ], ) recordIssues blameDisabled: true , enabledForFailure: true , aggregatingResults: false , tool: checkStyle () } return this This code snippet has three components, let's see what is happening here: Firstly, we run the original stage. This builds the application and optionally runs ESLint on JavaScript/TypeScript source files and static checks using PMD and SpotBugs tools as these are standard features of General Purpose Pipeline. Secondly, we run the checkstyle maven plugin using the mavenExecute Jenkins library step as provided by project \"Piper\". This serves as an example for how flexible you can re-use what project \"Piper\" already provides in your extension. Finally, we use the Jenkins Warnings NG plugin and its step recordIssues to make the findings visible in the Jenkins user interface. This example can be adapted for other linters of your choice. Be sure to checkout the Library steps section of this documentation if you want to do this. Project \"Piper\" provides some basic building blocks such as dockerExecute and the already mentioned mavenExecute which might be helpful. 2. Modified Ready-Made Pipeline \u00b6 This option describes how you can copy and paste one of the centrally maintained pipelines to make changes to it that are not possible otherwise. For example, you can't change the order of stages and the stages that run in parallel or add new stages to a centrally maintained pipeline. A modified Ready-Made Pipeline allows you to modify your declarative pipeline based on the syntax Jenkins provides . This might be done for an individual project (in the Jenkinsfile ), or in a separate Git repository so it can be used for multiple projects. Single project \u00b6 The default Jenkinsfile of centrally maintained pipelines does nothing else but loading the pipeline and running it. This is convenient but limits the modifiable aspects of the pipeline. If one of your projects uses the pipeline, the easiest way to do this modification is to copy the pipeline into your Jenkinsfile . The basic structure of your Jenkinsfile should be the following: @Library ( /* Shared library definition, see below */ ) _ call script: this void call ( parameters ) { // Your pipeline code based on our ready-made pipelines } The actual pipeline code (the call method in the listing above) can be found here: General purpose pipeline Use the correct shared library definition Which shared library you need depends on the pipeline you're using. For the general purpose pipeline , you need 'piper-lib-os' . For the version identifier, please see the section How to stay up-to-date in this document. Multiple projects \u00b6 If you have multiple projects that share a similar architecture, it might be desirable to share one modified pipeline amongst them. Similar to what you can do in an individual Jenkinsfile , you can copy the pipeline to your own shared library and modify it. To do this, create a new Git repository in your preferred Git hosting service. It must be compliant to how Jenkins shared libraries are built . In a nutshell, this means that you need a vars directory inside which you can place a copy of your preferred pipeline. A minimal example of such a library could have the following directory structure: ./vars/myCustomPipeline.groovy ./README.md myCustomPipeline.groovy contains the modified pipeline code of the general purpose pipeline . Note The name of your custom pipeline must differ from the other pipelines provided by project \"Piper\" because Jenkins requires names across multiple libraries to be unique. This library must be placed in a Git repository, which is available for Jenkins and must be configured in Jenkins as documented here . The following screenshot shows an example of the configuration in Jenkins. Note that the name (1) must be the same as the one you use in your Jenkinsfile . The Jenkinsfile of your individual projects would look similar to the following: @Library ([ 'piper-lib-os' , 'my-own-pipeline' ]) _ myCustomPipeline script: this Be sure to adapt the names and version identifiers accordingly, as described in How to stay up-to-date . How to stay up-to-date \u00b6 Regardless of which of the above options you choose, one downside of this approach is that your pipeline will be out of sync with the centrally maintained pipelines at some point in time. We strongly recommend doing as little modification as possible to fulfil your requirements. Please be aware that stages may have dependencies on each other. Don't depend on stage implementation details Your pipeline should treat stages as a black box, the stage implementations are not a published API and may be subject to change at any time. Avoid accidental breaking changes By default, Jenkins uses the master branch of shared libraries. This way, you're always automatically using the latest and greatest version. The downside is that in rare cases, breaking changes might happen. Another potential issue is that your builds are not repeatable , that means building the same version of your application twice might have a different result. For those reasons, you might want to consider to fix versions to a released version like in this example: @Library('my-shared-library@v1.0') _ Find the most recent release for the jenkins-library on GitHub. To stay up to date with the latest releases, you can \"watch\" releases for those repositories on GitHub . When to go with a modified ready-made pipeline This option is right for you if none of the provided ready-made pipelines serves your purpose, and individual stage extensions don't provide enough flexibility. Advanced tips and information \u00b6 When you consider adding additional capabilities, your first stop should be the Jenkins Pipeline Steps Reference . Here you get an overview of what kind of capabilities are already available and a list of related parameters, which you can use to customize the existing implementation. The provided information should help you understand and extend the functionality of your pipeline. 3. New Pipeline from Scratch \u00b6 Since project \"Piper\" fully builds on Jenkins Pipelines as Code , you can also go with your own pipeline from scratch in a Jenkinsfile . Decoupling If you choose this option, you will be decoupled from the innovations provided with project \"Piper\", unless you re-use stages (as indicated above under 2. Modified ready-made pipelines ), for example. We recommend using this only when none of the other provided options suit your use case.","title":"Extensibility"},{"location":"extensibility/#extensibility","text":"When using one of the ready-made pipelines of project \"Piper\", you don't have to write custom pipeline code.

We strongly recommend doing as little modification as possible to fulfil your requirements. Please be aware that stages may have dependencies on each other. Don't depend on stage implementation details Your pipeline should treat stages as a black box, the stage implementations are not a published API and may be subject to change at any time. Avoid accidental breaking changes By default, Jenkins uses the master branch of shared libraries. This way, you're always automatically using the latest and greatest version. The downside is that in rare cases, breaking changes might happen. Another potential issue is that your builds are not repeatable , that means building the same version of your application twice might have a different result. For those reasons, you might want to consider to fix versions to a released version like in this example: @Library('my-shared-library@v1.0') _ Find the most recent release for the jenkins-library on GitHub. To stay up to date with the latest releases, you can \"watch\" releases for those repositories on GitHub .

The public sample application cloud-cf-helloworld-nodejs will be enriched with a pipeline which syncs the sources, builds these as MTA and deploys the result into a Cloud Foundry environment. The application contains a simple nodejs application. Deployed as web service, it serves static data. Recommendation: We recommend to clone the sample application cloud-cf-helloworld-nodejs and execute the instructions on your own repository. See (Optional) Sample Application . The stated instructions assume the use of this application. Prerequisites \u00b6 You have installed a Linux system with at least 4 GB memory. Note: We have tested our samples on Ubuntu 16.04. On Microsoft Windows, you might face some issues. You have installed the newest version of Docker. See Docker Community Edition . Note: we have tested on Docker 18.09.6. Your system has access to GitHub.com . Recommended: Install the Cx Server Life-cycle Management for Jenkins \u00b6 Cx Server is a life-cycle management tool to bootstrap a pre-configured Jenkins instance within minutes. All required plugins and shared libraries are included automatically. It is based on Docker images provided by project \"Piper\". To get started, initialize Cx Server by using this docker run command: docker run -it --rm -u $( id -u ) : $( id -g ) -v \" ${ PWD } \" :/cx-server/mount/ ppiper/cx-server-companion:latest init-cx-server This creates a few files in your current working directory. The shell script cx-server and the configuration file server.cfg are of special interest. Now, you can start the Jenkins server by using the following command: chmod +x ./cx-server ./cx-server start For more information on the Cx Server and how to customize your Jenkins, have a look at the Operations Guide for Cx Server . For alternative approaches to setup a Jenkins build sever which fits the needs of the project \"Piper\" pipelines and steps please read the Infrastructure Overview . (Optional) Sample Application \u00b6 Choosing the best sample application Depending on the type of project you're interested in, different sample applications might be interesting. For SAP Cloud SDK, please have a look at the Address Manager example application. Copy the sources of the application into your own Git repository. While we will ask you to fork the application's repository into a GitHub space, you can use any version control system based on Git like GitLab or plain git . Note: A public GitHub repository is visible to the public. The configuration files may contain data you don't want to expose, so use a private repository. Create an organization on GitHub, if you haven't any yet. See Creating a new organization . Duplicate the repository cloud-cf-helloworld-nodejs into your GitHub organization. Make this repository private . Note: Forked public repositories cannot be made private. Get an account and space in the Cloud Foundry environment. For the deployment of the application you need access to a space on the Cloud Foundry environment of the SAP Cloud Platform. If you haven't any yet, get a Trial Account . Select the 1_REST_persist_in_Memory branch of your cloud-cf-helloworld-nodejs fork. Other branches might work as well, but this one is tested. Create Your First Pipeline \u00b6 Get your application repository in place. Create a new file with the name Jenkinsfile in the root level of your repository and enter the following code: @Library('piper-lib-os') _ node() { stage('prepare') { checkout scm setupCommonPipelineEnvironment script:this } } The \"prepare\" step synchronizes the repository and initializes the project specific settings. For more information about Jenkinsfiles and pipelines, see Using a Jenkinsfile . Save your changes to your remote repository. To set up a Jenkins job for your repository, open the Jenkins UI under http://<jenkins-server-address>:<http-port> and choose New Item . Per default, the cx-server starts Jenkins on HTTP port 80 . For more information, see the Jenkins User Documentation . Provide a name for your new item (for example, My First Pipeline ) and select Multibranch Pipeline . Note: The ready-made continuous delivery pipelines of project \"Piper\" must run as Multibranch Pipeline . For Branch Sources , choose Add source , select Git as source repository. For Project Repository in the Git section, enter the URL of your Git repository, for example https://github.com/<your-org>/cloud-cf-helloworld-nodejs . Note: If your repository is protected, you must provide your credentials in Credentials . For Discover branches , choose Add and Filter by name (with wildcards) . A multibranch pipeline can execute different Jenkinsfiles for different branches. In this case, however, configure the pipeline of a single branch only. For Include in the Filter by name section, enter the branch name 1_REST_persist_in_Memory . Choose Save . Result: Jenkins scans the repository for branches and filters them according to the specified Includes . If the branch is detected, it is built. For additional information about multibranch pipelines, please refer to the Jenkins documentation . Add a Build Step \u00b6 In your Jenkinsfile , add the following code snippet: stage('build') { mtaBuild script: this } The mtaBuild step calls a build tool to build a multi-target application (MTA). The tool consumes an MTA descriptor that contains the metadata of all entities which comprise an application or are used by one during deployment or runtime, and the dependencies between them. For more information about MTAs, see sap.com . Create the MTA descriptor file with the name mta.yaml in the root level of the repository. Insert the following code: _schema-version: 2.1.0 ID: com.sap.piper.node.hello.world version: 1.0.0 description: A Hello World sample application provider: SAP Sample generator modules: - name: piper.node.hello.world type: nodejs path: .

Save your changes to your remote repository. To run your pipeline, choose Build Now in the job UI. Result: The pipeline processed two stages, the \"prepare\" and the \"build\". Add a Deploy Step \u00b6 In your Jenkinsfile , add the following code snippet: stage('deploy') { cloudFoundryDeploy script: this } The cloudFoundryDeploy step calls the Cloud Foundry command line client to deploy the built MTA into SAP Cloud Platform. To configure the step to deploy into the Cloud Foundry environment, in your repository, open the .pipeline/config.yml and add the following content: cloudFoundryDeploy: deployTool: 'mtaDeployPlugin' deployType: 'standard' cloudFoundry: org: '<your-organisation>' space: '<your-space>' credentialsId: 'CF_CREDENTIALSID' Note: look after the indentation of the step within the YAML. Specify the organisation and space properties. For more information about the configuration, see the Common Configuration Guide and cloudFoundryDeploy . 1. The key CF_CREDENTIALSID refers to a user-password credential you must create in Jenkins: In Jenkins, choose Credentials from the main menu and add a Username with Password entry. Save the Credential Save your changes to your remote repository. To run your pipeline, choose Build Now in the job UI. Result: The pipeline processed the three stages \"prepare\", \"build\" and \"deploy\". If your pipeline fails, compare its files to the final Jenkinsfile , the config.yml , and the mta.yaml . Note : YAML files are surprisingly sensitive regarding indentation. Open Application \u00b6 Your application has been deployed into your space in the Cloud Foundry space on SAP Cloud Platform. Login to SAP Cloud Platform and navigate into you space. Result: Your space contains the application piper.node.hello.world , the state of the application is Started .

User Permission Issue \u00b6 Your native Jenkins installation defines the user jenkins as a service user. If it doesn't exist, it is created. In this case, the user ID is the next free number determined by /etc/passwd - probably starting from 100 . In contrast, the official Jenkins Docker image defines the user jenkins with the user ID 1000 as a service user inside the container. So, the service user ID of your native Jenkins server most likely differs from the user ID of the official Jenkins Docker image. This could have impacts. Project \"Piper\" runs many pipeline steps as Docker images. If a Docker container is created, the Jenkins Docker plugin passes the Jenkins user and group ID as a process owner into the Docker container. Binding a folder from the host machine into the container - used to exchange files between steps - results in file permission issues, if the user inside the container doesn't have rights for the folder on the host machine or vice versa. Although you won't face this issue with images of project \"Piper\" , some 3rd-party Docker images follow this convention and expect to be executed under userid 1000 , like node.js , which is used by a set of additional steps. If you face such a user permission issue , choose between the following options: Change the ID of your Jenkins service user to 1000 . Create your own images and solve the permission issues by removing the file system restrictions.

Docker Hub rate limiting Please be aware that Docker Hub as rate limiting active which might cause project \"Piper\" pipelines to fail. Refer to the page dedicated to docker rate limiting for details and solutions . The document and the linked resources explain the various ways of starting such a Jenkins server based on these Docker images. Cx Server (Recommended) \u00b6 Cx Server is a life-cycle management tool to bootstrap a pre-configured Jenkins instance within minutes on your own (virtual) server. It uses the Docker images mentioned above. As it would be cumbersome to start the Docker image manually with all required parameters and sidecar images, this command line tool automates the bootstraping. Setting up a Jenkins master \u00b6 For the following steps you will need a server or another machine which has Docker installed and configured. To get started, initialize the Cx Server by using this docker run command: docker run -it --rm -u $( id -u ) : $( id -g ) -v \" ${ PWD } \" :/cx-server/mount/ ppiper/cx-server-companion:latest init-cx-server This creates a few files in your current working directory. The shell script cx-server and the configuration file server.cfg are of special interest. Now, you can start the Jenkins server by using the following command: chmod +x ./cx-server ./cx-server start For more information on the Cx Server and how to customize your Jenkins, have a look at the Operations Guide for Cx Server . Setting up Jenkins agents \u00b6 With more and more qualities checked automatically in the pipeline, more and more resources are required to handle the workload. This section shows how to scale the pipeline by adding Jenkins build agents . However, before setting up agents please consider also other ways to scale the build infrastructure. It might be an option to have only one Jenkins master with lots of resources (cpu cores, memory) per project or team. This has the advantage of bringing more configuration flexibility and isolation for the individual teams but has the disadvantage that parts of the configuration have to be maintained twice. Furthermore, having agents and thus network communication between the build servers increases the risk of failures. To add an agent to the Jenkins master, please make sure to fulfil the following requirements similar to the ones for the Jenkins master: Access to a new server which runs on Linux Docker installed on this server The connection between the master and the agents will be established via ssh. As the Jenkins master runs in a Docker container, the ssh setup steps, such as creating and storing a private/public key pair or maintaining the konwn hosts file has to be done inside this container. To execute these steps inside the container, execute the following command on the server where the Jenkins master is running: docker exec -it cx-jenkins-master bash Inside the container make sure to be able to access the server where the Jenkins agent should be started by running the following command. As user you should use a user which is able to execute docker commands, i.e. starting a docker container. ssh <docker-user>@<host/ip> To be able to access the agent via ssh with the command above you might need to generate a new ssh key with ssh-keygen , store it in the .ssh folder and register the public key on the agent server. You might also need to add server\u2019s fingerprint to the list of known hosts. For more information around establishing a ssh connection please consult the ssh documentation . To setup a new Jenkins agent, open \"Manage Jenkins\" > \"Manage Nodes\" > \"New Nodes\" and create a new \"Permanent Agent\" Please define /var/jenkins_home as \"Remote root directory\". The launch method has to be \"Launch agent via execution of command on the master\" and the command should be: ./var/jenkins_home/launch-jenkins-agent.sh <user> <host> [image] . User and host should equal the values you used above to test the ssh connection. The following picture shows an example configuration. Kubernetes (Experimental) \u00b6 Hosting Jenkins master and agents means that we bind the required resources to the purpose of executing builds. There are good chances that, these resources stay idle for the most part of the day, i.e. if you have high peak loads. Autoscaling of the infrastructure solves such a problem. Instead of reserving the resources proactively, the pipeline creates the Jenkins agents dynamically on a Kubernetes cluster during the execution. Once the agent completes the dedicated task, it is deleted and the resources are freed. Project \"Piper\" supports running the pipeline as well as individual steps in a Kubernetes Cluster. Please note that this feature is currently only experimental. To setup the Jenkins master in Kubernetes you can use helm. The documentation to install Jenkins using helm can be found here . To use the Jenkins image provided by project Piper, pass ppiper/jenkins-master as a value for the Master.Image command line argument while deploying Jenkins to Kubernetes. The successfully completed deployment consists of a Jenkins pod with port 80 and 50000 exposed for HTTP and internal JNLP traffic respectively. The deployment also creates two services each to listen to incoming HTTP traffic on port 80 and the internal JNLP traffic on port 50000. Please note that in this example setup, the SSL/TLS termination happens at the load balancer, hence all the traffic between a load balancer and the Jenkins pod is unencrypted. Project \"Piper\" needs an environment variable set in the Jenkins to run the workload in Kubernetes. In order to set the environment variable, navigate to \"Manage Jenkins\" > \"Configure System\" > \"Global Properties\". Add an environment variable ON_K8S and set the value to true: Afterwards, you should be able to run project \"Piper\" pipelines in Kubernetes.

Specifically: To pull a software component to a system, the software component needs to be cloned first. It is planned to add the possibility to clone a software component repeatedly with the hotfix collection HFC03 of release 2102 Implications for the \u201cabapEnvironmentPipeline\u201d: If you are using the \u201cPrepare System\u201d stage to create a new ABAP Environment system, it is no longer possible to use the \u201cClone Repositories\u201d stage with the \u201cPull\u201d strategy or with the default strategy (no strategy specified). Please use the strategy \u201cClone\u201d instead. For more information, have a look at the stage documentation . The strategy \u201cAddonBuild\u201d will execute the abapEnvironmentCloneGitRepo instead of the previous logic. No configuration changes should be necessary. Please be aware that a repeated execution of a pipeline using the strategy \u201cClone\u201d or \u201cAddonBuild\u201d will not be possible until hotfix collection HFC03 (planned). The recommended workaround is to replace the strategy \u201cAddonBuild\u201d with \u201cCheckoutPull\u201d, whenever the system from a previous pipeline run is reused. 1. Prerequisites \u00b6 Configure your Jenkins Server according to the documentation . Create a git repository on a host reachable by the Jenkins server (e.g. GitHub.com). The pipeline will be configured in this repository. Create a GitHub User with read access. The entitlements for the ABAP Environment system are available in the SAP BTP global account and assigned to the subaccount. A Cloud Foundry Organization & Space with the allocated entitlements are available. A Cloud Foundry User & Password with the required authorization (\"Space Developer\") in the Organization and Space are available. User and Password were saved in the Jenkins Credentials Store. 2. Jenkinsfile \u00b6 Create a file named Jenkinsfile in your repository with the following content: @Library('piper-lib-os') _ abapEnvironmentPipeline script: this The annotation @Library('piper-lib-os') is a reference to the Jenkins Configuration, where you configured the Piper Library as a \"Global Pipeline Library\". If you want to avoid breaking changes we advise you to use a specific release of the Piper Library instead of the default master branch. This can be achieved by either adapting the configuration (see documentation ) or by specifying the release within the annotaion: @Library('piper-lib-os@v1.53.0') _ An Overview of the releases of the Piper Library can be found here . 3. Configuration for the Communication \u00b6 The communication to the ABAP system is done using a Communication Arrangement. The Communication Arrangement is created during the pipeline stage Prepare System after the system creation via the command cf create-service-key . The configuration for the command needs to be stored in a JSON file. Create the file sap_com_0510.json in the repository with the following content: { \"scenario_id\" : \"SAP_COM_0510\" , \"type\" : \"basic\" } Please have a look at the step documentation for more details. 4. Configuration for Cloning the repositories \u00b6 If you have specified the Clone Repositories Stage you can make use of a dedicated configuration file containing the repositories to be pulled and the branches to be switched on. The repositories flag makes use of such a configuration file and helps executing a Pull, Clone and Checkout of the Branches of the Repositores. Create the file repositories.yml with the following structure containing your repositories including the branches for this Stage. repositories: - name: '/DMO/GIT_REPOSITORY' branch: 'master' - name: '/DMO/GIT_REPO' branch: 'master' You can later use the repositories.yml file for the repositories parameter in the Clone Repositories stage used in chapter 7. Technical Pipeline Configuration . 5. Configuration for ATC \u00b6 Create a file atcConfig.yml to store the configuration for the ATC run. In this file, you can specify which Packages or Software Components shall be checked. Please have a look at the step documentation for more details. Here is an example of the configuration: atcobjects: softwarecomponent: - name: \"/DMO/REPO\" Please have a look at the step documentation for more details. 6. Technical Pipeline Configuration \u00b6 Create a file .pipeline/config.yml where you store the configuration for the pipeline, e.g. apiEndpoints and credentialIds. The steps make use of the Credentials Store of the Jenkins Server. Here is an example of the configuration file: general: cfApiEndpoint: 'https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com' cfOrg: 'your-cf-org' cfSpace: 'yourSpace' cfCredentialsId: 'cfAuthentification' cfServiceInstance: 'abapEnvironmentPipeline' cfServiceKeyName: 'jenkins_sap_com_0510' stages: Prepare System: cfService: 'abap' cfServicePlan: 'standard' abapSystemAdminEmail: 'user@example.com' abapSystemDescription: 'ABAP Environment Q System' abapSystemIsDevelopmentAllowed: false abapSystemID: 'H02' abapSystemSizeOfPersistence: 4 abapSystemSizeOfRuntime: 1 cfServiceKeyConfig: 'sap_com_0510.json' Clone Repositories: strategy: 'Clone' repositories: 'repositories.yml' ATC: atcConfig: 'atcConfig.yml' steps: cloudFoundryDeleteService: cfDeleteServiceKeys: true Some stages may only be executed if a certain condition is met. For example: the stage Prepare System will only be executed if it is configured in the stages section. Also, the created system will be deprovisioned in the cleanup routine - although it is necessary to configure the step cloudFoundryDeleteService as above. Prepare system \u00b6 The example values for the Prepare System stage are a suggestion. Please change them accordingly and don't forget to enter your own email address. Please be aware that creating a SAP Cloud ABAP Environment instance may incur costs. Please have a look at the step documentation for more details. Clone Repositories \u00b6 If the Clone Repositories stage is configured, you can specify the strategy that should be performed on the Software Components and the Branches that you have configured in the respositories.yml file in step 4. Configuration for Cloning the repositories . Per default the strategy will be set to Pull if not specified. The following strategies are supported and can be used on the Software Components and Branches: Pull : If you have specified Pull as the strategy the abapEnvironmentPullGitRepo step will be used Clone : If you have specified the Clone strategy the abapEnvironmentCloneGitRepo step will be used CheckoutPull : This strategy performs a Checkout of Branches with the abapEnvironmentCheckoutBranch step followed by a Pull of the Software Component with the abapEnvironmentPullGitRepo step AddonBuild : This will perform a Pull of the Software Component with the abapEnvironmentPullGitRepo step, a Checkout of Branches with the abapEnvironmentCheckoutBranch step followed by a Pull of the Software Component again with the abapEnvironmentPullGitRepo step Note that you can use the repositories.yml file with the repositories parameter consistently for all strategies. The values for cfApiEndpoint , cfOrg and cfSpace can be found in the respective overview pages in the SAP BTP Cockpit. The Cloud Foundry credentials, saved in the Jenkins credentials store with the ID cfCredentialsId , must refer to a user with the required authorizations (\"Space Developer\") for the Cloud Foundry Organization and Space. 7. Create a Jenkins Pipeline \u00b6 On your Jenkins server click on New Item to create a new pipeline. Provide a name and select the type Pipeline . On the creation screen for the pipeline, scroll to the section Pipeline and select Pipeline script from SCM . Provide the URL (and credentials - if required) of the repository, in which you configured the pipeline. Make sure the Script Path points to your Jenkinsfile - if you created the Jenkinsfile according to the documentation above, the default value should be correct. If you want to configure a build trigger, this can be done in the section of the same name. Here is one example: to run the pipeline every night, you can tick the box \"Run periodically\". In the visible input field, you can specify a shedule. Click on the questionsmark to read the documentation. The following example will result in the pipeline running every night between 3am and 4am. H H(3-4) * * * Extension \u00b6 You can extend each stage of this pipeline following the documentation . For example, this can be used to display ATC results utilizing the checkstyle format with the Warnings Next Generation Plugin ( GitHub Project ). To achieve this, create a file .pipeline/extensions/ATC.groovy with the following content: void call ( Map params ) { //access stage name echo \"Start - Extension for stage: ${params.stageName}\" //access config echo \"Current stage config: ${params.config}\" //execute original stage as defined in the template params . originalStage () recordIssues tools: [ checkStyle ( pattern: '**/ATCResults.xml' )], qualityGates: [[ threshold: 1 , type: 'TOTAL' , unstable: true ]] echo \"End - Extension for stage: ${params.stageName}\" } return this While tools: [checkStyle(pattern: '**/**/ATCResults.xml')] will display the ATC findings using the checkstyle format, qualityGates: [[threshold: 1, type: 'TOTAL', unstable: true]] will set the build result to UNSTABLE in case the ATC results contain at least one warning or error. Local Jenkins If you are using a local Jenkins you may have to adapt the Jenkins URL in the configuration if the CheckStyl Plugin shows this error: \"Can't create fingerprints for some files\". Stage Names \u00b6 The stage name for the extension is usually the displayed name, e.g. ATC.groovy or Prepare System.groovy . One exception is the generated Post stage. While the displayed name is \"Declarative: Post Actions\", you can extend this stage using Post.groovy .","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"pipelines/abapEnvironment/configuration/#configuration","text":"In general, the ABAP Environment pipeline supports different scenarios.

Context \u00b6 This procedure explains how to upload a multitarget application from a CI/CD pipeline to Transport Management and then import it into its target environment. Transport Management allows you to manage the transport of development artifacts and application-specific content between different SAP Cloud Platform accounts. It adds transparency to the audit trail of changes so that you get information about who performed which changes in your production accounts and when they did it. At the same time, Transport Management enables a separation of concerns: For example, a developer of an application or of SAP Cloud Platform content artifacts can trigger the propagation of changes, while the resulting transport is handled by a central operations team. For more information, see SAP Cloud Platform Transport Management . The following graphic provides an overview about the interplay between continuous integration and Transport Management: Prerequisites \u00b6 You have an existing CI pipeline, which you want to extend with Transport Management. You have an MTA project, and the folder structure of its sources corresponds to the standard MTA structure. For more information, see The Multitarget Application Model . You have access to Transport Management. See Provide Access to SAP Cloud Platform Transport Management . You have set up SAP Cloud Platform Transport Management and created a service key. See Set Up the Environment to Transport Content Archives directly in an Application . You have configured your transport landscape. See Configuring the Landscape . Procedure \u00b6 You can use this scenario to extend any CI process that meets the prerequisites, for example, the one described in Build and Deploy SAPUI5 or SAP Fiori Applications on SAP Cloud Platform with Jenkins . The following graphic shows an example of the detailed procedure when combining continuous integration and Transport Management: The process flow contains the following steps: The CI server builds a multitarget application (MTA) archive. The MTA is uploaded into the import queue of the target node, which is specified in the CI pipeline (in this example, PRE-PROD). Optionally, for transports in Cloud Foundry environment, MTA extension descriptors can be uploaded to the nodes in the transport landscape to provide node-specific import configurations. The MTA extension descriptor file must either be part of the repository, or be the result of the build process. The release manager manually triggers the import, or schedules it, which results in the physical deployment of the MTA archive into the corresponding subaccount (in this example, PRE-PROD). If an MTA extension descriptor was uploaded for this node, it will be used for the import. As soon as the import is executed, a transport is triggered along the defined transport route so that the MTA archive reaches the import queue of the next node (in this example, PROD). There, the physical import into the corresponding subaccount can be either triggered manually by the release manager or automatically by using the scheduling mechanisms of Transport Management. Example \u00b6 Jenkinsfile \u00b6 If you use the pipeline of the following code snippet, you only have to configure it in the .pipeline/config.yml. Following the convention for pipeline definitions, use a Jenkinsfile, which resides in the root directory of your development sources. @Library ( 'piper-lib-os' ) _ piperPipeline script: this Configuration ( .pipeline/config.yml ) \u00b6 This is a basic configuration example, which is also located in the sources of the project. steps : tmsUpload : credentialsId : tms-secret-key nodeName : PRE-PROD mtaPath : com.piper.example.tms.mtar customDescription : Custom-Transport-Description # uploading MTA extension descriptors, optional step mtaVersion : 1.0.0 nodeExtDescriptorMapping : PRE-PROD : 'scv_x_preprod.mtaext' PROD : 'scv_x_prod.mtaext' stages : Release : tmsUpload : true Configuration for the Upload to Transport Management \u00b6 Parameter Description credentialsId Credentials that are used for the file and node uploads to Transport Management. nodeName Defines the name of the node to which the *.mtar file is uploaded. mtaPath Defines the path to the *.mtar file for the upload to Transport Management. customDescription Optional: Description of a transport request.

Please be aware that a repeated execution of a pipeline using the strategy \u201cClone\u201d or \u201cAddonBuild\u201d will not be possible until hotfix collection HFC03 (planned). The recommended workaround is to replace the strategy \u201cAddonBuild\u201d with \u201cCheckoutPull\u201d, whenever the system from a previous pipeline run is reused. This scenario describes how an add-on for the SAP BTP ABAP Environment is built. It is intended for SAP partners who want to provide a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution on the SAP BTP using the ABAP Environment. Therefore, a partner development contract (see SAP PartnerEdge Test, Demo & Development Price List ) is required. This page aims to provide an overview of the build process of the add-on. The development on SAP BTP ABAP Environment systems is done within \u201csoftware components\u201d (also called: \u201crepositories\u201d). The add-ons being built in this scenario are made up by one or multiple software components combined to an add-on product. The \u201cABAP Environment Pipeline\u201d can be used to build and publish the add-on product. Please read on for more details about the Add-on Product and the build process. Of course, this tackles only the upstream part of the SaaS solution lifecycle. Once the add-on is published, it can be consumed as a multitenant application in ABAP Environment . The Add-on Product \u00b6 The installation and maintenance of ABAP software is done / controlled via add-on product versions. An add-on product version is a \u201ebundle\" of software component versions made available at the same time for implementing a well-defined scope of functionality. It is the technical / delivery view on a software portfolio. Add-on Product Version \u00b6 An add-on product version is defined by a name and a version string. The name of an add-on product is a string with a maximum of 30 characters and consists of the namespace and a freely chooseble part - /NAMESPC/PRODUCT1 . The version string consists of three numbers separated by a dot - 1.2.0 . The numbers in the version string have a hierarchic relationship: The first number denotes the release. Release deliveries contain the complete scope of functionality. It is possible to change the software component version bundle in a new release. The second number denotes the Support Package Stack level. A Support Package stack consists of Support Package deliveries of the contained software component versions. It is not possible to change the software component version bundle in such a delivery. The third number denotes the Patch level. A Patch delivery contains Patch deliveries of the contained software component versions. Development on SAP BTP ABAP Environment As you may know, the development in the SAP BTP ABAP Environment is done within software component . A software component is self-contained, and a reduced set of objects and features of the ABAP programming language can be used. The software component and development objects must be created in a namespace, so that clashes between software of different vendors and SAP are avoided. Therefore, a namespace must be reserved before the development can start. SAP note 105132 describes the namespace reservation process. The namespace must be reserved for the same customer number under which the \u201cSAP CP ABAP ENVIRONMENT\u201d tenants are licensed. Software Component Version \u00b6 A software component version is a technically distinguishable unit of software and is installed and patched as a whole. It consists of ABAP development packages and contained objects. Software component versions are delivered via delivery packages. But software component versions are not individual shipment entities. They can only be delivered to customers as part of an add-on product version . A software component version is defined by a name and a version string. The name of a software component is string with a maximum of 30 characters and consists of the namespace and a freely chooseble part - /NAMESPC/COMPONENT1. The version consists of three numbers separated by a dot - 1.2.0. The numbers in the version string have a hierarchic relationship: The first number denotes the release. Release deliveries contains the whole software component and deliver new and enhancements of existing functionalities. They are delivered with delivery packages of type \u201cInstallation Package\u201d . The second number denotes the Support Package level. Support Package deliveries contain a larger collection of corrections and may contains smaller functional enhancements. They are delivered with delivery packages of type \u201cComponent Support Package\u201d . The third number denotes the Patch level. Patch deliveries shall only contain small corrections. They are shipped with delivery packages of type \u201cCorrection Package\u201d. Note: The needed type of delivery does not need to be chosen manually; it is automatically determined by the delivery tools. Target Vector \u00b6 As explained above, the shipment of a software takes place via add-on product versions. The delivered content of an add-on product version is defined in a target vector, which is used by the deployment tools. The target vector is derived from the addon.yml (more on that below) and contains the following information: Product name Product release Product Support Package stack and Patch level A list of contained software component versions with Software component name Software component release Delivery Package, which delivers the versions Building the Add-on Product \u00b6 The build process of an add-on product is orchestrated by a Jenkins Pipeline, the \u201cABAP Environment Pipeline\u201d provided in this project. To run this pipeline, it only needs to be configured \u2013 which will be explained in the sections \u201cPrerequisites\u201d and \u201cConfiguration\u201d. The pipeline consists of different steps responsible for a single task. The steps themselves are grouped thematically into different stages. For example, early in the pipeline, the ABAP Environment system needs to be created and the communication needs to be set up. This is done in the \u201cPrepare System\u201d stage. You can read more about the different stages in the ABAP Environment Pipeline documentation . Different services and systems are required for the add-on build process. Delivery Tools \u00b6 With the following tools the add-on deliveries are created. Assembly System \u00b6 First the ABAP system responsible for the add-on assembly. It is created during the pipeline and deleted in the end. All actions related to the ABAP source code are executed on this system, e.g. running checks with the ABAP Test Cockpit (ATC) or the physical build of the software components. There are two communication scenarios containing the different APIs of the ABAP Environment System: Test Integration and Software Assembly Integration . The assembly system should be of service type abap and be provisioned with parameter is_development_allowed = false to prevent local changes. Add-on Assembly Kit as a Service (=AAKaaS) \u00b6 The Add-on Assembly Kit as a Service is responsible for registering and publishing the add-on product. It is accessible via APIs with an S-User. Deployment Tools \u00b6 With these SAP tools the assembled add-on deliveries are deployed to ABAP systems, for example into the installation test system . Installation Test System \u00b6 In order to verify that the delivery packages included in the add-on product version being built are installable, a target vector is published in \"test\" scope. In the Integration Tests stage an ABAP system of service plan saas_oem is created. This ABAP system makes it possible to install a specific add-on product version into an ABAP system that is provisioned. The installation test system should be be provisioned with parameter is_development_allowed = false to prevent local changes. Prerequisites \u00b6 There are several parts that are required to run the pipeline for building an ABAP Environment Add-on. Jenkins Server \u00b6 The pipeline responsible for building ABAP add-ons has been created specifically for Jenkins . Therefore, a Jenkins Server is required. The piper project provides a Jenkins image, which already includes the necessary configurations. Of course, it is also possible to configure an existing server . Git Repository \u00b6 The pipeline configuration is done in a git repository (for example on GitHub). This repository needs to be accessed by the Jenkins Server. If the repository is password protected, the user and password (or access token) should be stored in the Jenkins Credentials Store (Manage Jenkins \u2192 Manage Credentials). Add-on Assembly Kit as a Service (=AAKaaS) \u00b6 The communication with the AAKaaS needs a technical communication user. The creation and activation of such a user is described in SAP note 2174416 . Make sure that this technical communication user is assigned to the customer number under which the \u201cSAP CP ABAP ENVIRONMENT\u201d tenants are licensed and for which the development namespace was reserved. The user and password need to be stored in the Jenkins Credentials Store. Cloud Foundry Access \u00b6 ABAP Environment systems are created in the SAP BTP Cockpit. For this pipeline, the creation and deletion of the systems are automated via the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface: cf CLI . For this to work, two things need to be configured: Cloud Foundry needs to be enabled on subaccount level. This can be done on the Subaccount Overview page. The subaccount is then mapped to a \u201cCloud Foundry Organization\u201d, for which you must provide a suitable name during the creation. Have a look at the documentation for more details. A (technical) user is required to access the SAP BTP via the cf CLI. The user needs to be a member of the global account and has to have the Space Developer role. The user and password need to be stored in the Jenkins Credentials Store. Later, during the pipeline configuration, you will specify the Service Plan, which will be used for the creation of an ABAP Environment system. Please make sure, that there are enough entitlements for this Service Plan in the Subaccount . Register Add-on Product for a Global Account \u00b6 The add-on product needs to be registered with SAP in order to be installable in the desired global account. More details will follow soon. Configuration \u00b6 In the following subsections, the pipeline configuration for this scenario is explained. To get a general overview on the ABAP Environment Pipeline configuration, have a look here . In addition to the following sections explaining the configuration, there will be an example repository including all required files. Jenkinsfile \u00b6 This file is the entry point of the pipeline. It should look like this: @Library ( 'piper-lib-os' ) _ abapEnvironmentPipeline script: this The first line defines that the shared library, named \u201cpiper-lib-os\u201d in the Jenkins Configuration, will be used. This is a reference to the /SAP/Jenkins-library of Project Piper. Jenkins Library Version If desired, a specific release of this library can be requested: e.g. release 1.93.0 with @Library('piper-lib-os@v1.93.0') _ . As the library is an Open Source project, it is possible that incompatible changes are introduced. If you want to avoid this, it is recommended to use such a specific release. If no release is specified, the newest version of the Jenkins-library will be used (pulled from the master branch). The second line abapEnvironmentPipeline script: this defines that the predefined \u201cABAP Environment Pipeline\u201d will be executed. Pipeline configuration file \u00b6 A configuration file .pipeline/config.yml is used to provide all required values to run the pipeline. This includes - for example - different endpoints or credential IDs of user and password values stored in the Jenkins Credentials Store . If a complex configuration is necessary, a separate configuration file is required, which will also be referenced in the config.yml file. Add-on descriptor file \u00b6 The build process is controlled by an add-on descriptor file called addon.yml . This file must be created manually and must be stored in the GIT repository of the pipeline. It must contain information about the to-be-delivered add-on product version and the contained software component versions . Below, you see an example: --- addonProduct : /NAMESPC/PRODUCT1 addonVersion : 1.2.0 repositories : - name : /NAMESPC/COMPONENT1 branch : release-v.1.2.0 version : 1.2.0 commitID : 'cd87a3cac2bc946b7629580e58598c3db56a26f8' - name : /NAMESPC/COMPONENT2 branch : release-v.2.0.0 version : 2.0.0 commitID : '1f34b135da79dad7d498a31c15296270ff81dbd2' Explanation of the keys: addonProduct : this is the technical name of the add-on product addonVersion : This is the technical version of the add-on product <product version>.<support package stack level>.<patch level> The section \u201crepositories\u201d contains one or multiple software component versions: name : the technical name of the software component branch : this is the release branch from the git repository version : this is the technical software component version <software component version>.<support package level>.<patch level> Versioning Rules \u00b6 For the development and the provisioning of product-/software component versions, it is necessary to ensure, that there are no gaps within the version and level counters. Therefore, only a continuous increase in version numbers is allowed. The following examples show valid and invalid cases, respectively: Valid increase: 1.0.0 to 2.0.0 1.1.2 to 2.0.0 2.0.0 to 2.0.1 2.1.0 to 2.2.0 2.1.1 to 2.1.2 Invalid increase: 1.0.0 to 3.0.0 (version 2.0.0 is missing; therefore, a product/component version is missing) 1.1.2 to 2.1.0 (version 2.0.0 is missing; therefore, a product/component version is missing) 2.0.0 to 2.0.2 (version 2.0.1 is missing; therefore, a patch level is missing) 2.1.0 to 2.3.0 (version 2.2.0 is missing; therefore, a support package level is missing) 2.1.1 to 2.1.3 (version 2.1.2 is missing; therefore, a patch level is missing) Jenkins Job \u00b6 Once, the configuration in the git repository is completed, the pipeline on the Jenkins Server can be created. On your Jenkins Server click on \u201cNew Item\u201d to create a new pipeline. Provide a name and select the type \u201cPipeline\u201d. On the creation screen for the pipeline, scroll to the section Pipeline and select \u201cPipeline script from SCM\u201d. Provide the URL (and credentials - if required) of the repository in which you configured the pipeline. Make sure the \u201cScript Path\u201d points to your Jenkinsfile - if you created the Jenkinsfile according to the documentation above, the default value should be correct. Make sure to check the general option \"Do not allow concurrent builds\" in order to prevent concurrent add-on build processes for the same version. Example \u00b6 Please have a look at the configuration example in this GitHub repository . Troubleshooting \u00b6 If you encounter an issue with the pipeline itself, please open an issue in GitHub .

Upcoming 2102 release of SAP BTP ABAP Environment With the upcoming 2102 release of SAP BTP ABAP Environment some changes to the backend behavior of the MANAGE_GIT_REPOSITORY service are introduced. Specifically: To pull a software component to a system, the software component needs to be cloned first. It is planned to add the possibility to clone a software component repeatedly with the hotfix collection HFC03 of release 2102 Implications for the \u201cabapEnvironmentPipeline\u201d: If you are using the \u201cPrepare System\u201d stage to create a new ABAP Environment system, it is no longer possible to use the \u201cClone Repositories\u201d stage with the \u201cPull\u201d strategy or with the default strategy (no strategy specified). Please use the strategy \u201cClone\u201d instead. For more information, have a look at the stage documentation .

In Steampunk, the development is done within \u201csoftware components\u201d (also called: \u201crepositories\u201d) and \"transported\" via git-based approaches. The ABAP Environment Pipeline is a predefined pipeline, which can be used to import ABAP development into a quality system and execute tests. Upcoming 2102 release of SAP BTP ABAP Environment With the upcoming 2102 release of SAP BTP ABAP Environment some changes to the backend behavior of the MANAGE_GIT_REPOSITORY service are introduced. Specifically: To pull a software component to a system, the software component needs to be cloned first. It is planned to add the possibility to clone a software component repeatedly with the hotfix collection HFC03 of release 2102 Implications for the \u201cabapEnvironmentPipeline\u201d: If you are using the \u201cPrepare System\u201d stage to create a new ABAP Environment system, it is no longer possible to use the \u201cClone Repositories\u201d stage with the \u201cPull\u201d strategy or with the default strategy (no strategy specified). Please use the strategy \u201cClone\u201d instead. For more information, have a look at the stage documentation . The strategy \u201cAddonBuild\u201d will execute the abapEnvironmentCloneGitRepo instead of the previous logic. No configuration changes should be necessary. Please be aware that a repeated execution of a pipeline using the strategy \u201cClone\u201d or \u201cAddonBuild\u201d will not be possible until hotfix collection HFC03 (planned). The recommended workaround is to replace the strategy \u201cAddonBuild\u201d with \u201cCheckoutPull\u201d, whenever the system from a previous pipeline run is reused. Pipeline \u00b6 For this scenario three stages of the ABAP Environment Pipeline are relevant: \"Prepare System\", \"Clone Repositories\" and \"ATC\". Prepare System \u00b6 The pipeline starts with the stage \"Prepare System\". This stage, however, is optional. If this stage is active , a new Steampunk system is created for each pipeline execution. This has the advantage, that each test runs on a fresh system without a history. On the other hand, the duration of each pipeline execution will increase as the system provisioning takes a significant amount of time. If this stage is not active , you have to provide a prepared Steampunk (quality) system for the other stages. Then, each pipeline execution runs on the same system. Of course, the system has a history, but the pipeline duration will be shorter. Please also consider: the total costs may increase for a static system in contrast to a system, which is only active during the pipeline. Clone Repositories \u00b6 This stage is responsible for cloning (or pulling) the defined software components (repositories) to the system. ATC \u00b6 This stage runs ATC checks on the SAP BTP ABAP Environment system. The results are returned in the \"CheckStyle\" format. With the help of a stage extension, a plugin can be used to visualize the check results. Prerequisites \u00b6 There are several parts that are required to run the pipeline. Jenkins Server \u00b6 The pipeline for testing software components has been created specifically for Jenkins . Therefore, a Jenkins Server is required. The piper project provides a Jenkins image, which already includes the necessary configurations. Of course, it is also possible to configure an existing server . Git Repository \u00b6 The pipeline configuration is done in a git repository (for example on GitHub). This repository needs to be accessed by the Jenkins Server. If the repository is password protected, the user and password (or access token) should be stored in the Jenkins Credentials Store (Manage Jenkins \u2192 Manage Credentials). Cloud Foundry Access \u00b6 ABAP Environment systems are created in the SAP BTP Cockpit. For this pipeline, the creation and deletion of the systems are automated via the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface: cf CLI . For this to work, two things need to be configured: Cloud Foundry needs to be enabled on subaccount level. This can be done on the Subaccount Overview page. The subaccount is then mapped to a \u201cCloud Foundry Organization\u201d, for which you must provide a suitable name during the creation. Have a look at the documentation for more details. A (technical) user is required to access the SAP BTP via the cf CLI. The user needs to be a member of the global account and has to have the Space Developer role. The user and password need to be stored in the Jenkins Credentials Store. During the pipeline configuration, you will specify the Service Plan, which will be used for the creation of an ABAP Environment system. Please make sure, that there are enough entitlements for this Service Plan in the Subaccount .

Note: This is only required if you don't use a Docker-based environment. Context \u00b6 In many SAP development scenarios, it is vital to synchronize both backend and frontend deliveries. These deliveries are typically an SAP UI5 application and an ABAP backend from which it is served. The SAP UI5 parts are often developed using agile practices and use Continuous Integration pipelines that automatically build, test, and deploy the application. Note This scenario description is an example. You can apply the process to other scenarios and component sets, as well. In this scenario, we want to show how an agile development process with Jenkins CI can automatically feed changes into SAP Solution Manager. In SAP Solution Manager, all parts of the application stack come together and can be subject to classic change and transport management. The basic workflow is as follows: The pipeline scans the Git commit messages for a line like ChangeDocument : <changeDocumentId> , and validates that the change is in the correct status in development . For more information, see checkChangeInDevelopment . An example for the commit message looks as follows: Fix terminology in documentation Terminology must be consistent with official channels. ChangeDocument: <Your Change Document ID> Note: The blank line between message header and message description is mandatory. To communicate with SAP Solution Manager, the pipeline uses credentials that must be stored on Jenkins using the credential ID CM . For more information, see checkChangeInDevelopment . The required transport request is created on the fly. Note: The change document can contain various components (for example, UI and backend components). The changes of your development team trigger the Jenkins pipeline. It builds and validates the changes and attaches them to the respective transport request.

Generally, you can choose between two technical ways to attach a binary to an ABAP transport request: We support uploads through RFC and through OData. Which option to use depends on the version of your ABAP system. For AS ABAP 7.50 SP08, 7.51 SP07, or 7.52 SP03 and newer, use the OData-based upload, for older versions, use the RFC-based upload. Prerequisites \u00b6 You have set up your Docker environment . You have set up project \u201cPiper\u201d. See guided tour . You have a transport request. In General it is possible to create a transport request on the fly. But the example here is based on an already existing transport request. Depending on the version of the ABAP system: Docker image for attaching binaries to transport requests via RFC available. Due to legal reasons there is no pre-build docker image. How to create the docker image is explained here Project Prerequisites \u00b6 This scenario requires additional files in your project and in the execution environment on your Jenkins instance. On the project level, provide and adjust the following template: File Name Description Position mta.yaml This file controls the behavior of the MTA toolset. Place the mta.yaml file in your application root folder and adjust the values in brackets with your data. Depending on the modules in your MTA, additional configuration files are required, e.g. pom.xml or package.json . Context \u00b6 This scenario combines various different steps to create a complete pipeline. In this scenario, we want to show how to build an application based on SAPUI5 or SAP Fiori by using the multitarget application (MTA) concept and how to attach the build result to a transport request inside an ABAP system. This document comprises the mtaBuild and the transportRequestUploadFile steps. In case of an RFC based upload the binary is not streamed to the ABAP endpoint. Instead an URL pointing to the binary needs to be provided. Hence the binary must be published first so that it can be accessed via HTTP. This can happen by uploading the binary to a blob store or by archiving the artifact on Jenkins. The corresponding URL needs to be provided when the artifact is attached to the transport request. The transport request can be created on the fly (see transportRequestCreate ) or we can use an already existing transport request. In case we use an already existing transport request Id the transport request Id needs to be provided in the git commit history (see example below) or the transport request Id needs to be provided inside the job (e.g. as a job parameter). The transport request can be closed by the pipeline job (see transportRequestRelease ). This is an example of a Git commit message containing the transport request ID: The headline The body. The blank line above is mandatory (Git standard). TransportRequest: <YOUR TRANSPORT REQUEST ID> By default, the Git commits between the merge base with the base branch (default: master ) and the current branch head are traversed.

This can happen by uploading the binary to a blob store or by archiving the artifact on Jenkins. The corresponding URL needs to be provided when the artifact is attached to the transport request. The transport request can be created on the fly (see transportRequestCreate ) or we can use an already existing transport request. In case we use an already existing transport request Id the transport request Id needs to be provided in the git commit history (see example below) or the transport request Id needs to be provided inside the job (e.g. as a job parameter).

First step: Pull Request Pipeline \u00b6 In order to validate pull-requests to your GitHub repository you need to perform two simple steps: 1. Create Pipeline configuration \u00b6 Create a file .pipeline/config.yml in your repository (typically in master branch) with the following content: general : buildTool : 'npm' buildTool Please make sure that you specify the correct build tool. Following are currently supported: docker kaniko maven mta npm If your build tool is not in the list you can still use further options as described for Pull-Request Voting Stage 2. Create Jenkinsfile \u00b6 Create a file called Jenkinsfile in the root of your repository (typically in master branch) with the following content: @Library ( 'piper-lib-os' ) _ piperPipeline script: this There is typically no need to further touch this file Using custom defaults It is possible to overwrite/extend the pipeline defaults with custom defaults. piperPipeline script: this, customDefaults: ['myCustomDefaults.yml'] You find more details about the custom defaults in the configuration section Second step: Prepare pipeline for your main branch \u00b6 Extend your configuration to also contain git ssh credentials information. Your .pipeline/config.yml should then look like: general : buildTool : 'npm' gitSshKeyCredentialsId : 'credentials-id-in-jenkins' gitSshKeyCredentialsId The pointer to the Jenkins credentials containing your ssh private key is an important part of the pipeline run. The credentials are for example required to push automatic versioning information to your GitHub repository. Subsequent steps: Configure individual stages \u00b6 The stages of the pipeline can be configured individually. As a general rule of thumb, only stages with an existing configuration are executed. If no dedicated configuration is required for a step, the precence of relevant files in the repository trigger the step execution. This smart and context-aware way of configuration allows you an iterative approach to configuring the individual steps. The pipeline comprises following stages: Init \u00b6 This stage takes care that the pipeline is initialized correctly. It will for example: Check out the GitHub repository Set up the overall pipeline configuration and perform basic checks Identify which pipeline stages to execute based on the configuration and file patterns Perform automatic versioning of the software artifact in case the master branch pipeline is executed. You find details about this stage on Init Stage Details Pull-Request Voting \u00b6 This stage is responsible for validating pull-requests, see also above. You find further details about this stage on the page Pull-Request Voting . Build \u00b6 In this stage the build of the software artifact is performed. The build artifact will be stash ed for use in subsequent stages. For Docker builds the build result will be uploaded to a container registry (as per your configuration). Afterwards the results of static checks & unit tests are published on the Jenkins. You find details about this stage on the page Build . Additional Unit Tests \u00b6 In this stage additional unit-like tests are executed which should not run during the build. Currently, this stage holds the execution of a Karma runner which allows for qUnit tests OPA5 (One Page Acceptance tests) for SAP UI5 You find details about this stage on the page Additional Unit Tests . Integration \u00b6 The Integration stage allows to run test based on maven, npm, or a custom integration test script. If more flexibility is required, consider using the stage extension mechanism . You find details about this stage on the page Integration . Acceptance \u00b6 In this stage the application/service is typically deployed and automated acceptance tests are executed. This is to make sure that new functionality is tested end-to-end there is no end-to-end regression in existing functionality You find details about this stage on the page Acceptance . Security \u00b6 This stage can run security checks using Checkmarx, Synopsys Detect, Fortify and WhiteSource. You find details about this stage on the page Security .

This can be created manually on cloud foundry. In a pipeline, you can do this, for example, with the step cloudFoundryCreateService . Communication Scenario \u201cSAP Cloud Platform ABAP Environment - Software Assembly Integration (SAP_COM_0582)\u201c is setup for this system. E.g. a Communication User , a Communication System and a Communication Arrangement are configured. This can be done manually through the respective applications on the SAP Cloud Platform ABAP Environment System, or through creating a service key for the system on cloud foundry with the parameters {\u201cscenario_id\u201d: \u201cSAP_COM_0582\", \u201ctype\u201d: \u201cbasic\u201d}. In a pipeline, you can do this, for example, with the step cloudFoundryCreateServiceKey . You have following options to provide the ABAP endpoint configuration: The host and credentials the Cloud Platform ABAP Environment system itself. The credentials must be configured for the Communication Scenario SAP_COM_0582. The Cloud Foundry parameters (API endpoint, organization, space), credentials, the service instance for the ABAP service and the service key for the Communication Scenario SAP_COM_0582. Only provide one of those options with the respective credentials. If all values are provided, the direct communication (via host) has priority. The step needs information about the packages which should be assembled present in the CommonPipelineEnvironment. For each repository/component version it needs the name of the repository, the version, splevel, patchlevel, namespace, packagename, package type, the status of the package, and optional the predecessor commit id. To upload this information to the CommonPipelineEnvironment run prior to this step the steps: abapAddonAssemblyKitCheckCVs , abapAddonAssemblyKitReserveNextPackages . If one of the package is already in status released, the assembly for this package will not be executed. The Software Components for which packages are to be assembled need to be present in the system. This can be done manually through the respective applications on the SAP Cloud Platform ABAP Environment System. In a pipeline, you can do this, for example, with the step abapEnvironmentPullGitRepo . The packages to be assembled need to be reserved in AAKaaS and the corresponding information needs to be present in CommonPipelineEnvironment. To do so run step abapAddonAssemblyKitReserveNextPackages prior this step.

In this case, calling the step in the Jenkinsfile is reduced to one line: abapEnvironmentRunATCCheck script: this If you want to provide the host and credentials of the Communication Arrangement directly, the configuration could look as follows: steps : abapEnvironmentRunATCCheck : abapCredentialsId : 'abapCredentialsId' , host : 'https://myABAPendpoint.com' , atcConfig : 'atcconfig.yml' , ATC run via Cloud Foundry Service Key example in Jenkinsfile \u00b6 The following example triggers an ATC run via reading the Service Key of an ABAP instance in Cloud Foundry. You can store the credentials in Jenkins and use the cfCredentialsId parameter to authenticate to Cloud Foundry. The username and password to authenticate to ABAP system will then be read from the Cloud Foundry Service Key that is bound to the ABAP instance. This can be done accordingly: abapEnvironmentRunATCCheck ( cfApiEndpoint : 'https://test.server.com' , cfOrg : 'cfOrg' , cfSpace: 'cfSpace' , cfServiceInstance: 'myServiceInstance' , cfServiceKeyName: 'myServiceKey' , abapCredentialsId: 'cfCredentialsId' , atcConfig: 'atcconfig.yml' , script: this , ) To trigger the ATC run an ATC config file atcconfig.yml will be needed. Check section 'ATC config file example' for more information. ATC run via direct ABAP endpoint configuration in Jenkinsfile \u00b6 This example triggers an ATC run directly on the ABAP endpoint. In order to trigger the ATC run you have to pass the username and password for authentication to the ABAP endpoint via parameters as well as the ABAP endpoint/host. You can store the credentials in Jenkins and use the abapCredentialsId parameter to authenticate to the ABAP endpoint/host. This must be configured as following: abapEnvironmentRunATCCheck ( abapCredentialsId: 'abapCredentialsId' , host: 'https://myABAPendpoint.com' , atcConfig: 'atcconfig.yml' , script: this , ) To trigger the ATC run an ATC config file atcconfig.yml will be needed. Check section 'ATC config file example' for more information. ATC config file example \u00b6 The following section contains an example of an atcconfig.yml file. This file must be stored in the same Git folder where the Jenkinsfile is stored to run the pipeline. This folder must be taken as a SCM in the Jenkins pipeline to run the pipeline. You can specify a list of packages and/or software components to be checked. This must be in the same format as below example for a atcconfig.yml file. For each package that has to be checked you can configure if you want the subpackages to be included in checks or not. Please note that if you chose to provide both packages and software components to be checked with the atcconfig.yml file, the set of packages and the set of software components will be combinend by the API using a logical AND operation. Therefore, we advise to specify either the Software Components or Packages.

Description \u00b6 Prepares and potentially updates the artifact's version before building the artifact. The continuous delivery process requires that each build is done with a unique version number. There are two common patterns found: 1. Continuous Deployment pattern with automatic versioning \u00b6 The team has full authority on <major>.<minor>.<patch> and can increase any part whenever required. Nonetheless, the automatic versioning makes sure that every build will create a unique version by appending <major>.<minor>.<patch> with a buildversion (we use a timestamp) and optionally the commitId. In order to represent this version also in the version control system the new unique version will be pushed with a dedicated tag ( <tagPrefix><major>.<minor>.<patch><unique extension> ). Depending on the build tool used and thus the allowed versioning format the <unique extension> varies. Remarks: There is no commit to master since this would create a perpetuum mobile and just trigger the next automatic build with automatic versioning, and so on ... Not creating a tag would lead to a loss of the final artifact version in scm which often is not acceptable You need to ensure that your CI/CD system can push back to your SCM (via providing ssh or HTTP(s) credentials) This pattern is the default behavior ( versioningType: cloud ) since this is suitable for most cloud deliveries. It is possible to use versioningType: cloud_noTag which has a slightly different behavior than described above: The new version will NOT be written as tag into the SCM but it is only available in the corresponding CI/CD workspace IMPORTANT NOTICE: Using the option cloud_noTag should not be picked in case you need to ensure a fully traceable path from SCM commit to your build artifact. 2. Pure version <major>.<minor>.<patch> \u00b6 This pattern is often used by teams that have cloud deliveries with no fully automated procedure, e.g. delivery after each takt. Another typical use-case is development of a library with regular releases where the versioning pattern should be consumable and thus ideally complies to a <major>.<minor>.<patch> pattern. The version is then either manually set by the team in the course of the development process or automatically pushed to master after a successful release. Unlike for the Continuous Deloyment pattern described above, in this case there is no dedicated tagging required for the build process since the version is already available in the repository. Configuration of this pattern is done via versioningType: library . Support of additional build tools \u00b6 Besides the buildTools provided out of the box (like maven , mta , npm , ...) it is possible to set buildTool: custom .

Nonetheless, the automatic versioning makes sure that every build will create a unique version by appending <major>.<minor>.<patch> with a buildversion (we use a timestamp) and optionally the commitId. In order to represent this version also in the version control system the new unique version will be pushed with a dedicated tag ( <tagPrefix><major>.<minor>.<patch><unique extension> ). Depending on the build tool used and thus the allowed versioning format the <unique extension> varies. Remarks: There is no commit to master since this would create a perpetuum mobile and just trigger the next automatic build with automatic versioning, and so on ... Not creating a tag would lead to a loss of the final artifact version in scm which often is not acceptable You need to ensure that your CI/CD system can push back to your SCM (via providing ssh or HTTP(s) credentials) This pattern is the default behavior ( versioningType: cloud ) since this is suitable for most cloud deliveries. It is possible to use versioningType: cloud_noTag which has a slightly different behavior than described above: The new version will NOT be written as tag into the SCM but it is only available in the corresponding CI/CD workspace IMPORTANT NOTICE: Using the option cloud_noTag should not be picked in case you need to ensure a fully traceable path from SCM commit to your build artifact.","title":"1.

The version is then either manually set by the team in the course of the development process or automatically pushed to master after a successful release.

This follows the behavior of cf push --vars-file , and can be used as a pre-deployment step if commands other than cf push are used for deployment (e.g. cf blue-green-deploy ). The format to reference a variable in the manifest YAML file is to use double parentheses (( and )) , e.g. ((variableName)) . You can declare variable assignments as key value-pairs inside a YAML variables file following the Cloud Foundry standards format. Optionally, you can also specify a direct list of key-value mappings for variables using the manifestVariables parameter. Variables given in the manifestVariables list will take precedence over those found in variables files. This follows the behavior of cf push --var , and works in combination with manifestVariablesFiles . The step is activated by the presence of the file specified by the manifestFile parameter and all variables files specified by the manifestVariablesFiles parameter, or if variables are passed in directly via manifestVariables . In case no manifestVariablesFiles were explicitly specified, a default named manifest-variables.yml will be looked for and if present will activate this step also. This is to support convention over configuration. Parameters \u00b6 name mandatory default possible values manifestFile no manifestVariables no manifestVariablesFiles no outputManifestFile no script yes manifestFile - The String path of the Yaml file to replace variables in. Defaults to \"manifest.yml\" if not specified otherwise. manifestVariables - A List of Map entries for key-value pairs used for variable substitution within the file given by manifestFile . Defaults to an empty list, if not specified otherwise. This can be used to set variables like it is provided by cf push --var key=value . The order of the maps of variables given in the list is relevant in case there are conflicting variable names and values between maps contained within the list. In case of conflicts, the last specified map in the list will win. Though each map entry in the list can contain more than one key-value pair for variable substitution, it is recommended to stick to one entry per map, and rather declare more maps within the list. The reason is that if a map in the list contains more than one key-value entry, and the entries are conflicting, the conflict resolution behavior is undefined (since map entries have no sequence). Note: variables defined via manifestVariables always win over conflicting variables defined via any file given by manifestVariablesFiles - no matter what is declared before. This reproduces the same behavior as can be observed when using cf push --var in combination with cf push --vars-file . manifestVariablesFiles - The List of String paths of the Yaml files containing the variable values to use as a replacement in the manifest file. Defaults to [\"manifest-variables.yml\"] if not specified otherwise. The order of the files given in the list is relevant in case there are conflicting variable names and values within variable files. In such a case, the values of the last file win. outputManifestFile - The String path of the Yaml file to produce as output. If not specified this will default to manifestFile and overwrite it. script - The common script environment of the Jenkinsfile running. Typically the reference to the script calling the pipeline step is provided with the this parameter, as in script: this .

The list might be incomplete. Consider using the ppiper/jenkins-master docker image. This images comes with preinstalled plugins. Side effects \u00b6 Unless configured otherwise, this step will replace the input manifest.yml with a version that has all variable references replaced. This alters the source tree in your Jenkins workspace. If you prefer to generate a separate output file, use the step's outputManifestFile parameter.

Also in this file you can specify variable references, that can be resolved from the same variables file, e.g. like this: // resolve variables in manifest.yml cfManifestSubstituteVariables ( script: this , manifestFile: \"manifest.yml\" , manifestVariablesFiles: [ \"manifest-variables.yml\" ] ) // resolve variables in services-manifest.yml from same file. cfManifestSubstituteVariables ( script: this , manifestFile: \"services-manifest.yml\" , manifestVariablesFiles: [ \"manifest-variables.yml\" ] )","title":"cfManifestSubstituteVariables"},{"location":"steps/cfManifestSubstituteVariables/#cfmanifestsubstitutevariables","text":"","title":"cfManifestSubstituteVariables"},{"location":"steps/cfManifestSubstituteVariables/#description","text":"Step to substitute variables in a given YAML file with those specified in one or more variables files given by the manifestVariablesFiles parameter. This follows the behavior of cf push --vars-file , and can be used as a pre-deployment step if commands other than cf push are used for deployment (e.g. cf blue-green-deploy ). The format to reference a variable in the manifest YAML file is to use double parentheses (( and )) , e.g. ((variableName)) . You can declare variable assignments as key value-pairs inside a YAML variables file following the Cloud Foundry standards format. Optionally, you can also specify a direct list of key-value mappings for variables using the manifestVariables parameter. Variables given in the manifestVariables list will take precedence over those found in variables files. This follows the behavior of cf push --var , and works in combination with manifestVariablesFiles . The step is activated by the presence of the file specified by the manifestFile parameter and all variables files specified by the manifestVariablesFiles parameter, or if variables are passed in directly via manifestVariables . In case no manifestVariablesFiles were explicitly specified, a default named manifest-variables.yml will be looked for and if present will activate this step also.

Defaults to \"manifest.yml\" if not specified otherwise. manifestVariables - A List of Map entries for key-value pairs used for variable substitution within the file given by manifestFile . Defaults to an empty list, if not specified otherwise. This can be used to set variables like it is provided by cf push --var key=value . The order of the maps of variables given in the list is relevant in case there are conflicting variable names and values between maps contained within the list. In case of conflicts, the last specified map in the list will win. Though each map entry in the list can contain more than one key-value pair for variable substitution, it is recommended to stick to one entry per map, and rather declare more maps within the list. The reason is that if a map in the list contains more than one key-value entry, and the entries are conflicting, the conflict resolution behavior is undefined (since map entries have no sequence). Note: variables defined via manifestVariables always win over conflicting variables defined via any file given by manifestVariablesFiles - no matter what is declared before. This reproduces the same behavior as can be observed when using cf push --var in combination with cf push --vars-file . manifestVariablesFiles - The List of String paths of the Yaml files containing the variable values to use as a replacement in the manifest file. Defaults to [\"manifest-variables.yml\"] if not specified otherwise.

You can set the optional cfCreateServiceConfig flag to configure the Service creation with your respective JSON configuration. The JSON configuration can either be an in-line JSON string or the path a dedicated JSON configuration file containing the JSON configuration. If you chose a dedicated config file, you must store the file in the same folder as your Jenkinsfile that starts the Pipeline in order for the Pipeline to be able to find the file. Most favourable SCM is Git. If you want the service to be created from a particular broker you can set the optional cfServiceBroker flag. You can set user provided tags for the Service creation using a flat list as the value for the optional cfServiceTags flag. The optional cfServiceBroker flag can be used when the service name is ambiguous. For creating one or multiple Cloud Foundry Services at once with the Cloud Foundry Create-Service-Push Plugin using the optional serviceManifest flag. If you chose to set this flag, the Create-Service-Push Plugin will be used for all Service creations in this step and you will need to provide a serviceManifest.yml file.

It makes use of the cfCreateServiceConfig flag for passing a JSON configuration as an in-line parameter string as well as the cfServiceTags for providing user tags. You can store the credentials in Jenkins and use the cfCredentialsId parameter to authenticate to Cloud Foundry. This can be done accordingly: cloudFoundryCreateService ( cfApiEndpoint : 'https://test.server.com' , cfOrg : 'cfOrg' , cfSpace: 'cfSpace' , cfCredentialsId: 'cfCredentialsId' , cfService: 'myService' , cfServiceInstanceName: 'myServiceInstanceName' , cfServicePlan: 'myPlan' , cfCreateServiceConfig: '{\\\"example\\\":\\\"value\\\",\\\"example\\\":\\\"value\\\"}' , cfServiceTags: 'list, of, tags' , script: this , ) If you chose to having a dedicated JSON file for the JSON configuration for the cfCreateServiceConfig flag you can do so by referencing the file path accordingly. This file should be stored in the same folder as your Jenkinsfile that starts the Pipeline in order for the Pipeline to be able to find the file. Most favourable SCM is Git. Such a JSON file with the appropriate step configuration could look as follows: The JSON config file, e.g. createServiceConfig.json can look like this: { \"example\" : \"value\" , \"example\" : \"value\" } The step configuration needs to contain the path to the JSON file: cloudFoundryCreateService ( cfApiEndpoint : 'https://test.server.com' , cfOrg : 'cfOrg' , cfSpace: 'cfSpace' , cfCredentialsId: 'cfCredentialsId' , cfService: 'myService' , cfServiceInstanceName: 'myServiceInstanceName' , cfServicePlan: 'myPlan' , cfCreateServiceConfig: 'createServiceConfig.json' , cfServiceTags: 'list, of, tags' , script: this , ) Multiple Service Creation in Cloud Foundry example with manifest file in Jenkinsfile \u00b6 The following example shows the option to create multiple Services in Cloud Foundry. It makes use of the Cloud Foundry Create-Service-Push Plugin. This is described in above Prerequisites, please check this section for further information regarding its usage. This plugin enables this step to create multiple Cloud Foundry Services in one step. It requires a dedicated YAML file, e.g. manifest.yml , that contains all the information for creating the services, including their names, service plan and the service broker. Such a manifest.yml file needs to have the following structure, e.g. for creating three mongoDB Services with the Service Plan v4.0-dev: --- create-services : - name : \"testDatabase1\" broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" - name : \"testDatabase2\" broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" - name : \"testDatabase3\" broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" The path of the manifest.yml config file needs to be passed as a parameter in the serviceManifest flag. You can store the credentials in Jenkins and use the cfCredentialsId parameter to authenticate to Cloud Foundry. This can be done accordingly: cloudFoundryCreateService ( cfApiEndpoint : 'https://test.server.com' , cfOrg : 'cfOrg' , cfSpace: 'cfSpace' , cfCredentialsId: 'cfCredentialsId' , serviceManifest: 'manifest.yml' , script: this , ) Multiple Service Creation in Cloud Foundry example with manifest file and variable substitution in Jenkinsfile \u00b6 Additionally the Cloud Foundry Create-Service-Push Plugin offers the option to make use of variable substitution. This enables you to rename variables in the manifest.yml dynamically. It can be done either via providing the file path to a dedicated YAML file containing the information regarding the variable substitution values in the manifestVariablesFiles flag or via providing a String List in the manifestVariables flag. Either ways can be achieved as seen in below examples for creating MongoDB instances. For both ways you need to adapt the manifest.yml file to be relevant for variable substitution. This can be done according to below example: --- create-services : - name : ((name1)) broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" - name : ((name2)) broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" - name : ((name3)) broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" If you chose to have a dedicated file for the variable substitution values, it needs to have the following structure of the vars.yml file: name1 : test1 name2 : test2 name3 : test3 The path of the manifest.yml config file needs to be passed as a parameter in the serviceManifest flag as well as the path to the vars.yml file in the manifestVariablesFiles flag. You can store the credentials in Jenkins and use the cfCredentialsId parameter to authenticate to Cloud Foundry. This can be done accordingly: cloudFoundryCreateService ( cfApiEndpoint : 'https://test.server.com' , cfOrg : 'cfOrg' , cfSpace: 'cfSpace' , cfCredentialsId: 'cfCredentialsId' , serviceManifest: 'manifest.yml' , manifestVariablesFiles: 'vars.yml' , script: this , ) You can also pass the values for the variable substition as a string list for the manifestVariables flag. This needs to follow the pattern key=value. This can be done accordingly: cloudFoundryCreateService ( cfApiEndpoint : 'https://test.server.com' , cfOrg : 'cfOrg' , cfSpace: 'cfSpace' , cfCredentialsId: 'cfCredentialsId' , serviceManifest: 'manifest.yml' , manifestVariables: [ \"name1=test1\" , \"name2=test2\" , \"name3=test3\" ], script: this , )","title":"cloudFoundryCreateService"},{"location":"steps/cloudFoundryCreateService/#cloudfoundrycreateservice","text":"Creates one or multiple Services in Cloud Foundry","title":"cloudFoundryCreateService"},{"location":"steps/cloudFoundryCreateService/#description","text":"Creates one or multiple Cloud Foundry Services in Cloud Foundry Mandatory: * Cloud Foundry API endpoint, Organization, Space and user are available Please provide either of the following options: If you chose to create a single Service the Service Instance Name, Service Plan and Service Broker of the Service to be created have to be available. You can set the optional cfCreateServiceConfig flag to configure the Service creation with your respective JSON configuration. The JSON configuration can either be an in-line JSON string or the path a dedicated JSON configuration file containing the JSON configuration. If you chose a dedicated config file, you must store the file in the same folder as your Jenkinsfile that starts the Pipeline in order for the Pipeline to be able to find the file. Most favourable SCM is Git. If you want the service to be created from a particular broker you can set the optional cfServiceBroker flag. You can set user provided tags for the Service creation using a flat list as the value for the optional cfServiceTags flag. The optional cfServiceBroker flag can be used when the service name is ambiguous. For creating one or multiple Cloud Foundry Services at once with the Cloud Foundry Create-Service-Push Plugin using the optional serviceManifest flag. If you chose to set this flag, the Create-Service-Push Plugin will be used for all Service creations in this step and you will need to provide a serviceManifest.yml file. In that case, above described flags and options will not be used for the Service creations, since you chose to use the Create-Service-Push Plugin. Please see below examples for more information on how to make use of the plugin with the appropriate step configuation.

It makes use of the Cloud Foundry Create-Service-Push Plugin. This is described in above Prerequisites, please check this section for further information regarding its usage. This plugin enables this step to create multiple Cloud Foundry Services in one step. It requires a dedicated YAML file, e.g. manifest.yml , that contains all the information for creating the services, including their names, service plan and the service broker. Such a manifest.yml file needs to have the following structure, e.g. for creating three mongoDB Services with the Service Plan v4.0-dev: --- create-services : - name : \"testDatabase1\" broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" - name : \"testDatabase2\" broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" - name : \"testDatabase3\" broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" The path of the manifest.yml config file needs to be passed as a parameter in the serviceManifest flag.

It can be done either via providing the file path to a dedicated YAML file containing the information regarding the variable substitution values in the manifestVariablesFiles flag or via providing a String List in the manifestVariables flag. Either ways can be achieved as seen in below examples for creating MongoDB instances. For both ways you need to adapt the manifest.yml file to be relevant for variable substitution. This can be done according to below example: --- create-services : - name : ((name1)) broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" - name : ((name2)) broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" - name : ((name3)) broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" If you chose to have a dedicated file for the variable substitution values, it needs to have the following structure of the vars.yml file: name1 : test1 name2 : test2 name3 : test3 The path of the manifest.yml config file needs to be passed as a parameter in the serviceManifest flag as well as the path to the vars.yml file in the manifestVariablesFiles flag.

If your application contains a list of buildpacks instead a single buildpack , this will be automatically re-written by the step when blue-green deployment is used. Note Cloud Foundry supports the deployment of multiple applications using a single manifest file. This option is supported with Piper.

If not specified, takes the value of config.verbose. cloudFoundry/apiEndpoint - Cloud Foundry API endpoint. cloudFoundry/appName - Defines the name of the application to be deployed to the Cloud Foundry space. cloudFoundry/credentialsId - Credentials to be used for deployment. cloudFoundry/credentialsId', null, {c -> return !c.containsKey('vaultAppRoleTokenCredentialsId') || !c.containsKey('vaultAppRoleSecretTokenCredentialsId - cloudFoundry/manifest - Defines the manifest to be used for deployment to Cloud Foundry. cloudFoundry/manifestVariables - Defines a List of variables as key-value Map objects used for variable substitution within the file given by manifest . Defaults to an empty list, if not specified otherwise. This can be used to set variables like it is provided by cf push --var key=value . The order of the maps of variables given in the list is relevant in case there are conflicting variable names and values between maps contained within the list. In case of conflicts, the last specified map in the list will win. Though each map entry in the list can contain more than one key-value pair for variable substitution, it is recommended to stick to one entry per map, and rather declare more maps within the list. The reason is that if a map in the list contains more than one key-value entry, and the entries are conflicting, the conflict resolution behavior is undefined (since map entries have no sequence). Note: variables defined via manifestVariables always win over conflicting variables defined via any file given by manifestVariablesFiles - no matter what is declared before. This is the same behavior as can be observed when using cf push --var in combination with cf push --vars-file . cloudFoundry/manifestVariablesFiles - Defines the manifest variables Yaml files to be used to replace variable references in manifest. This parameter is optional and will default to [\"manifest-variables.yml\"] . This can be used to set variable files like it is provided by cf push --vars-file <file> . If the manifest is present and so are all variable files, a variable substitution will be triggered that uses the cfManifestSubstituteVariables step before deployment. The format of variable references follows the Cloud Foundry standard . cloudFoundry/org - Cloud Foundry target organization. cloudFoundry/space - Cloud Foundry target space. deployDockerImage - Docker image deployments are supported (via manifest file in general)[https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest-attributes.html#docker]. If no manifest is used, this parameter defines the image to be deployed. The specified name of the image is passed to the --docker-image parameter of the cf CLI and must adhere it's naming pattern (e.g. REPO/IMAGE:TAG). See (cf CLI documentation)[https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/push-docker.html] for details. Note: The used Docker registry must be visible for the targeted Cloud Foundry instance. deployTool - Defines the tool which should be used for deployment. If it is not set it will be inferred automatically based on the buildTool, i.e., for MTA projects mtaDeployPlugin will be used and cf_native for other types of projects. deployType - Defines the type of deployment, either standard deployment, which results in a system downtime, or a zero-downtime blue-green deployment. If 'cf_native' as deployTool and 'blue-green' as deployType is used in combination, your manifest.yaml may only contain one application. If this application has the option 'no-route' active the deployType will be changed to 'standard'. dockerCredentialsId - If the specified image in deployDockerImage is contained in a Docker registry, which requires authorization this defines the credentials to be used. dockerImage - Name of the docker image that should be used. Configure with empty value to execute the command directly on the Jenkins system (not using a container). Omit to use the default image (cf. default_pipeline_environment.yml ) Overwrite to use custom Docker image. dockerWorkspace - Kubernetes only: Specifies a dedicated user home directory for the container which will be passed as value for environment variable HOME . keepOldInstance - In case of a blue-green deployment the old instance will be deleted by default. If this option is set to true the old instance will remain stopped in the Cloud Foundry space. loginParameters - Addition command line options for cf login command. No escaping/quoting is performed. Not recommanded for productive environments. mtaDeployParameters - Additional parameters passed to mta deployment command. mtaExtensionCredentials - Defines a map of credentials that need to be replaced in the mtaExtensionDescriptor . This map needs to be created as value-to-be-replaced : id-of-a-credential-in-jenkins mtaExtensionDescriptor - Defines additional extension descriptor file for deployment with the mtaDeployPlugin. mtaPath - Defines the path to *.mtar for deployment with the mtaDeployPlugin. If not specified, it will use the mta file created in mtaBuild or search for an mtar file in the workspace. script - The common script environment of the Jenkinsfile running. Typically the reference to the script calling the pipeline step is provided with the this parameter, as in script: this . This allows the function to access the commonPipelineEnvironment for retrieving, e.g. configuration parameters. smokeTestScript - Allows to specify a script which performs a check during blue-green deployment. The script gets the FQDN as parameter and returns exit code 0 in case check returned smokeTestStatusCode . More details can be found here Currently this option is only considered for deployTool cf_native . smokeTestStatusCode - Expected status code returned by the check. stashContent - Specific stashes that should be considered for the step execution. useGoStep - Toggle to activate the new go-implementation of the step. Off by default. verbose - Provides more output. May reveal sensitive information. Step configuration \u00b6 We recommend to define values of step parameters via config.yml file . In following sections of the config.yml the configuration is possible: parameter general step/stage apiParameters X X buildTool X X cfNativeDeployParameters X X cfTrace X X cloudFoundry/apiEndpoint X X cloudFoundry/appName X X cloudFoundry/credentialsId X X cloudFoundry/credentialsId', null, {c -> return !c.containsKey('vaultAppRoleTokenCredentialsId') || !c.containsKey('vaultAppRoleSecretTokenCredentialsId X X cloudFoundry/manifest X X cloudFoundry/manifestVariables X X cloudFoundry/manifestVariablesFiles X X cloudFoundry/org X X cloudFoundry/space X X deployDockerImage X X deployTool X X deployType X X dockerCredentialsId X X dockerImage X X dockerWorkspace X X keepOldInstance X X loginParameters X X mtaDeployParameters X X mtaExtensionCredentials X X mtaExtensionDescriptor X X mtaPath X X script smokeTestScript X X smokeTestStatusCode X X stashContent X X useGoStep X X verbose X X Dependencies \u00b6 The step depends on the following Jenkins plugins credentials-binding docker kubernetes pipeline-utility-steps ssh-agent workflow-basic-steps workflow-cps-global-lib workflow-durable-task-step The kubernetes plugin is only used if running in a kubernetes environment.

Defaults to an empty list, if not specified otherwise. This can be used to set variables like it is provided by cf push --var key=value . The order of the maps of variables given in the list is relevant in case there are conflicting variable names and values between maps contained within the list. In case of conflicts, the last specified map in the list will win. Though each map entry in the list can contain more than one key-value pair for variable substitution, it is recommended to stick to one entry per map, and rather declare more maps within the list. The reason is that if a map in the list contains more than one key-value entry, and the entries are conflicting, the conflict resolution behavior is undefined (since map entries have no sequence). Note: variables defined via manifestVariables always win over conflicting variables defined via any file given by manifestVariablesFiles - no matter what is declared before. This is the same behavior as can be observed when using cf push --var in combination with cf push --vars-file . cloudFoundry/manifestVariablesFiles - Defines the manifest variables Yaml files to be used to replace variable references in manifest. This parameter is optional and will default to [\"manifest-variables.yml\"] . This can be used to set variable files like it is provided by cf push --vars-file <file> . If the manifest is present and so are all variable files, a variable substitution will be triggered that uses the cfManifestSubstituteVariables step before deployment. The format of variable references follows the Cloud Foundry standard . cloudFoundry/org - Cloud Foundry target organization. cloudFoundry/space - Cloud Foundry target space. deployDockerImage - Docker image deployments are supported (via manifest file in general)[https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest-attributes.html#docker]. If no manifest is used, this parameter defines the image to be deployed. The specified name of the image is passed to the --docker-image parameter of the cf CLI and must adhere it's naming pattern (e.g. REPO/IMAGE:TAG). See (cf CLI documentation)[https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/push-docker.html] for details. Note: The used Docker registry must be visible for the targeted Cloud Foundry instance. deployTool - Defines the tool which should be used for deployment. If it is not set it will be inferred automatically based on the buildTool, i.e., for MTA projects mtaDeployPlugin will be used and cf_native for other types of projects. deployType - Defines the type of deployment, either standard deployment, which results in a system downtime, or a zero-downtime blue-green deployment.

The properties will be added to the pod spec inside node spec at the same level like e.g. containers . This property provides some kind of an expert mode. Any property which is not handled otherwise by the step can be set. It is not possible to overwrite e.g. the containers property or to overwrite the securityContext property. Alternate way for providing additionalPodProperties is via general/jenkinsKubernetes/additionalPodProperties in the project configuration. Providing the resources map as parameter to the step call takes precedence. This freedom comes with great responsibility. The property additionalPodProperties should only be used in case you really know what you are doing. containerCommand - Allows to specify start command for container created with dockerImage parameter to overwrite Piper default ( /usr/bin/tail -f /dev/null ). containerCommands - Specifies start command for containers to overwrite Piper default ( /usr/bin/tail -f /dev/null ). If container's defaultstart command should be used provide empty string like: ['selenium/standalone-chrome': ''] . containerEnvVars - Specifies environment variables per container. If not provided dockerEnvVars will be used. containerMap - A map of docker image to the name of the container. The pod will be created with all the images from this map and they are labelled based on the value field of each map entry. Example: ['maven:3.5-jdk-8-alpine': 'mavenExecute', 'selenium/standalone-chrome': 'selenium', 'famiko/jmeter-base': 'checkJMeter', 'ppiper/cf-cli': 'cloudfoundry'] containerName - Optional configuration in combination with containerMap to define the container where the commands should be executed in. containerPortMappings - Map which defines per docker image the port mappings, e.g. containerPortMappings: ['selenium/standalone-chrome': [[name: 'selPort', containerPort: 4444, hostPort: 4444]]] . containerPullImageFlags - Specifies the pullImage flag per container. containerShell - Allows to specify the shell to be executed for container with containerName. containerWorkspaces - Specifies a dedicated user home directory per container which will be passed as value for environment variable HOME . If not provided dockerWorkspace will be used. dockerEnvVars - Environment variables to set in the container, e.g. [http_proxy:'proxy:8080']. dockerImage - Optional name of the docker image that should be used. If no docker image is provided, the closure will be executed in the jnlp agent container. dockerPullImage - Set this to 'false' to bypass a docker image pull. Useful during development process. Allows testing of images which are available in the local registry only. dockerWorkspace - Specifies a dedicated user home directory for the container which will be passed as value for environment variable HOME . jenkinsKubernetes/inheritFrom - Name of the pod template that should be inherited from. The pod template can be defined in the Jenkins UI jenkinsKubernetes/jnlpAgent - Jnlp agent Docker images which should be used to create new pods. jenkinsKubernetes/namespace - Namespace that should be used to create a new pod nodeSelector - Defines the Kubernetes nodeSelector as per https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin . resources - A map containing the resources per container. The key is the container name. The value is a map defining valid resources. An entry with key DEFAULT can be used for defining resources for all containers which does not have resources specified otherwise. Alternate way for providing resources is via general/jenkinsKubernetes/resources in the project configuration. Providing the resources map as parameter to the step call takes precedence. script - The common script environment of the Jenkinsfile running. Typically the reference to the script calling the pipeline step is provided with the this parameter, as in script: this . This allows the function to access the commonPipelineEnvironment for retrieving, e.g. configuration parameters. securityContext - Kubernetes Security Context used for the pod. Can be used to specify uid and fsGroup. See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/ sidecarEnvVars - as dockerEnvVars for the sidecar container sidecarImage - as dockerImage for the sidecar container sidecarName - SideCar only: Name of the container in local network. sidecarPullImage - Set this to 'false' to bypass a docker image pull. Useful during development process. Allows testing of images which are available in the local registry only. sidecarReadyCommand - Command executed inside the container which returns exit code 0 when the container is ready to be used. sidecarWorkspace - as dockerWorkspace for the sidecar container stashContent - Specific stashes that should be considered for the step execution. stashExcludes - In the Kubernetes case the workspace is only available to the respective Jenkins slave but not to the containers running inside the pod. This configuration defines exclude pattern for stashing from Jenkins workspace to working directory in container and back. Following excludes can be set: * workspace : Pattern for stashing towards container * stashBack : Pattern for bringing data from container back to Jenkins workspace. If not set: defaults to setting for workspace . stashIncludes - In the Kubernetes case the workspace is only available to the respective Jenkins slave but not to the containers running inside the pod.

The property additionalPodProperties should only be used in case you really know what you are doing. containerCommand - Allows to specify start command for container created with dockerImage parameter to overwrite Piper default ( /usr/bin/tail -f /dev/null ). containerCommands - Specifies start command for containers to overwrite Piper default ( /usr/bin/tail -f /dev/null ). If container's defaultstart command should be used provide empty string like: ['selenium/standalone-chrome': ''] . containerEnvVars - Specifies environment variables per container. If not provided dockerEnvVars will be used. containerMap - A map of docker image to the name of the container. The pod will be created with all the images from this map and they are labelled based on the value field of each map entry. Example: ['maven:3.5-jdk-8-alpine': 'mavenExecute', 'selenium/standalone-chrome': 'selenium', 'famiko/jmeter-base': 'checkJMeter', 'ppiper/cf-cli': 'cloudfoundry'] containerName - Optional configuration in combination with containerMap to define the container where the commands should be executed in. containerPortMappings - Map which defines per docker image the port mappings, e.g. containerPortMappings: ['selenium/standalone-chrome': [[name: 'selPort', containerPort: 4444, hostPort: 4444]]] . containerPullImageFlags - Specifies the pullImage flag per container. containerShell - Allows to specify the shell to be executed for container with containerName. containerWorkspaces - Specifies a dedicated user home directory per container which will be passed as value for environment variable HOME . If not provided dockerWorkspace will be used. dockerEnvVars - Environment variables to set in the container, e.g. [http_proxy:'proxy:8080']. dockerImage - Optional name of the docker image that should be used. If no docker image is provided, the closure will be executed in the jnlp agent container. dockerPullImage - Set this to 'false' to bypass a docker image pull. Useful during development process. Allows testing of images which are available in the local registry only. dockerWorkspace - Specifies a dedicated user home directory for the container which will be passed as value for environment variable HOME . jenkinsKubernetes/inheritFrom - Name of the pod template that should be inherited from. The pod template can be defined in the Jenkins UI jenkinsKubernetes/jnlpAgent - Jnlp agent Docker images which should be used to create new pods. jenkinsKubernetes/namespace - Namespace that should be used to create a new pod nodeSelector - Defines the Kubernetes nodeSelector as per https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin . resources - A map containing the resources per container. The key is the container name. The value is a map defining valid resources. An entry with key DEFAULT can be used for defining resources for all containers which does not have resources specified otherwise. Alternate way for providing resources is via general/jenkinsKubernetes/resources in the project configuration. Providing the resources map as parameter to the step call takes precedence. script - The common script environment of the Jenkinsfile running. Typically the reference to the script calling the pipeline step is provided with the this parameter, as in script: this . This allows the function to access the commonPipelineEnvironment for retrieving, e.g. configuration parameters. securityContext - Kubernetes Security Context used for the pod. Can be used to specify uid and fsGroup. See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/ sidecarEnvVars - as dockerEnvVars for the sidecar container sidecarImage - as dockerImage for the sidecar container sidecarName - SideCar only: Name of the container in local network. sidecarPullImage - Set this to 'false' to bypass a docker image pull. Useful during development process. Allows testing of images which are available in the local registry only. sidecarReadyCommand - Command executed inside the container which returns exit code 0 when the container is ready to be used. sidecarWorkspace - as dockerWorkspace for the sidecar container stashContent - Specific stashes that should be considered for the step execution. stashExcludes - In the Kubernetes case the workspace is only available to the respective Jenkins slave but not to the containers running inside the pod. This configuration defines exclude pattern for stashing from Jenkins workspace to working directory in container and back. Following excludes can be set: * workspace : Pattern for stashing towards container * stashBack : Pattern for bringing data from container back to Jenkins workspace. If not set: defaults to setting for workspace . stashIncludes - In the Kubernetes case the workspace is only available to the respective Jenkins slave but not to the containers running inside the pod. This configuration defines include pattern for stashing from Jenkins workspace to working directory in container and back. Following includes can be set: * workspace : Pattern for stashing towards container * stashBack : Pattern for bringing data from container back to Jenkins workspace. If not set: defaults to setting for workspace . stashNoDefaultExcludes - In the Kubernetes case the workspace is only available to the respective Jenkins slave but not to the containers running inside the pod. This configuration defines include pattern for stashing from Jenkins workspace to working directory in container and back. This flag controls whether the stashing does not use the default exclude patterns in addition to the patterns provided in stashExcludes . verbose - Print more detailed information into the log.","title":"Parameters"},{"location":"steps/dockerExecuteOnKubernetes/#step-configuration","text":"We recommend to define values of step parameters via config.yml file .

How to setup this monitoring is described in the following. You basically need three components: The InfluxDB Jenkins plugin which allows you to send build metrics to InfluxDB servers The InfluxDB to store this data (Docker available) A Grafana dashboard to visualize the data stored in InfluxDB (Docker available) no InfluxDB available? If you don't have an InfluxDB available yet this step will still provide you some benefit. It will create following files for you and archive them into your build: jenkins_data.json : This file gives you build-specific information, like e.g. build result, stage where the build failed influx_data.json : This file gives you detailed information about your pipeline, e.g. stage durations, steps executed, ... Prerequisites \u00b6 Setting up InfluxDB with Grafana \u00b6 The easiest way to start with is using the available official docker images. You can either run these docker containers on the same host on which you run your Jenkins or each docker on individual VMs (hosts). Very basic setup can be done like that (with user \"admin\" and password \"adminPwd\" for both InfluxDB and Grafana): docker run -d -p 8083:8083 -p 8086:8086 --restart=always --name influxdb -v /var/influx_data:/var/lib/influxdb influxdb docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name grafana --restart=always --link influxdb:influxdb -e \"GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=adminPwd\" grafana/grafana For more advanced setup please reach out to the respective documentation: InfluxDB ( Docker Hub GitHub ) Grafana ( Docker Hub GitHub ) After you have started your InfluxDB docker you need to create a database: in a Webbrowser open the InfluxDB Web-UI using the following URL: <host of your docker>:8083 (port 8083 is used for access via Web-UI, for Jenkins you use port 8086 to access the DB) create new DB (the name of this DB you need to provide later to Jenkins) create Admin user (this user you need to provide later to Jenkins) With InfluxDB version 1.1 the InfluxDB Web-UI is deprecated You can perform the above steps via commandline: The following command will create a database with name <databasename> curl -i -XPOST http://localhost:8086/query --data-urlencode \"q=CREATE DATABASE \\<databasename\\>\" The admin user with the name <adminusername> and the password <adminuserpwd> can be created with curl -i -XPOST http://localhost:8086/query --data-urlencode \"q=CREATE USER \\<adminusername\\> WITH PASSWORD '\\<adminuserpwd\\>' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES\" Once you have started both docker containers and Influx and Grafana are running you need to configure the Jenkins Plugin according to your settings. Pipeline configuration \u00b6 To setup your Jenkins you need to do two configuration steps: Configure Jenkins (via Manage Jenkins) Adapt pipeline configuration Configure Jenkins \u00b6 Once the plugin is available in your Jenkins: go to \"Manage Jenkins\" > \"Configure System\" > scroll down to section \"influxdb target\" maintain Influx data Jenkins as a Service For Jenkins as a Service instances this is already preset to the local InfluxDB with the name jenkins . In this case there is not need to do any additional configuration. Adapt pipeline configuration \u00b6 You need to define the influxDB server in your pipeline as it is defined in the InfluxDb plugin configuration (see above). influxDBServer = jenkins Parameters \u00b6 name mandatory default possible values artifactVersion no customData no customDataMap no customDataMapTags no customDataTags no influxPrefix no influxServer no `` script yes sonarTokenCredentialsId no wrapInNode no artifactVersion - Defines the version of the current artifact. Defaults to commonPipelineEnvironment.getArtifactVersion() customData - Defines custom data (map of key-value pairs) to be written to Influx into measurement jenkins_custom_data . Defaults to commonPipelineEnvironment.getInfluxCustomData() customDataMap - Defines a map of measurement names containing custom data (map of key-value pairs) to be written to Influx. Defaults to commonPipelineEnvironment.getInfluxCustomDataMap() customDataMapTags - Defines a map of measurement names containing tags (map of key-value pairs) to be written to Influx. Defaults to commonPipelineEnvironment.getInfluxCustomDataTags() customDataTags - Defines tags (map of key-value pairs) to be written to Influx into measurement jenkins_custom_data . Defaults to commonPipelineEnvironment.getInfluxCustomDataTags() influxPrefix - Defines a custom prefix. For example in multi branch pipelines, where every build is named after the branch built and thus you have different builds called 'master' that report different metrics. influxServer - Defines the name of the Influx server as configured in Jenkins global configuration. script - The common script environment of the Jenkinsfile running. Typically the reference to the script calling the pipeline step is provided with the this parameter, as in script: this . This allows the function to access the commonPipelineEnvironment for retrieving, e.g. configuration parameters. sonarTokenCredentialsId - wrapInNode - Defines if a dedicated node/executor should be created in the pipeline run. This is especially relevant when running the step in a declarative POST stage where by default no executor is available. Step configuration \u00b6 We recommend to define values of step parameters via config.yml file . In following sections of the config.yml the configuration is possible: parameter general step/stage artifactVersion X customData X customDataMap X customDataMapTags X customDataTags X influxPrefix X influxServer X script sonarTokenCredentialsId X wrapInNode X Dependencies \u00b6 The step depends on the following Jenkins plugins credentials-binding pipeline-utility-steps workflow-basic-steps workflow-cps-global-lib workflow-durable-task-step Transitive dependencies are omitted. The list might be incomplete. Consider using the ppiper/jenkins-master docker image. This images comes with preinstalled plugins. Example \u00b6 influxWriteData script: this Work with InfluxDB and Grafana \u00b6 You can access your Grafana via Web-UI: <host of your grafana(-docker)>:<port3000> (or another port in case you have defined another one when starting your docker) As a first step you need to add your InfluxDB as Data source to your Grafana: Login as user admin (PW as defined when starting your docker) in the navigation go to data sources -> add data source: name type: InfluxDB Url: http://<host of your InfluxDB server>:<port> Access: direct (not via proxy) database: <name of the DB as specified above> User: <name of the admin user as specified in step above> Password: <password of the admin user as specified in step above> Jenkins as a Service For Jenkins as a Service the data source configuration is already available. Therefore no need to go through the data source configuration step unless you want to add additional data sources. Data collected in InfluxDB \u00b6 The Influx plugin collects following data in the Piper context: All data as per default InfluxDB plugin capabilities Additional data collected via InfluxData.addField(measurement, key, value) Add custom information to your InfluxDB You can simply add custom data collected during your pipeline runs via available data objects. Example: //add data to measurement jenkins_custom_data - value can be a String or a Number commonPipelineEnvironment . setInfluxCustomDataProperty ( 'myProperty' , 2018 ) Collected InfluxDB measurements \u00b6 Measurements are potentially pre-fixed - see parameter influxPrefix above.

Please keep this in mind when specifying your project_name for a InfluxDB query. Example 1: Select last 10 successful builds \u00b6 select top ( build_number , 10 ), build_result from jenkins_data WHERE build_result = 'SUCCESS' Example 2: Select last 10 step names of failed builds \u00b6 select top ( build_number , 10 ), build_result , build_step from jenkins_custom_data WHERE build_result = 'FAILURE' Example 3: Select build duration of step for a specific project \u00b6 select build_duration / 1000 from \"pipeline_data\" WHERE project_name = 'PiperTestOrg_piper_test_master' Example 4: Get transparency about successful/failed steps for a specific project \u00b6 select top ( build_number , 10 ) AS \"Build\" , build_url , build_quality , fortify , gauge , vulas , opa from step_data WHERE project_name = 'PiperTestOrg_piper_test_master' Note With this query you can create transparency about which steps ran successfully / not successfully in your pipeline and which ones were not executed at all.

Supports MTA, npm and (multi-module) Maven projects. MTA files will be uploaded to a Maven repository. The uploaded file-type depends on your project structure and step configuration. To upload Maven projects, you need a pom.xml in the project root and set the mavenRepository option. To upload MTA projects, you need a mta.yaml in the project root and set the mavenRepository option. To upload npm projects, you need a package.json in the project root and set the npmRepository option. npm: Publishing npm projects makes use of npm's \"publish\" command. It requires a \"package.json\" file in the project's root directory which has \"version\" set and is not delared as \"private\". To find out what will be published, run \"npm publish --dry-run\" in the project's root folder. It will use your gitignore file to exclude the mached files from publishing. Note: npm's gitignore parser might yield different results from your git client, to ignore a \"foo\" directory globally use the glob pattern \"**/foo\". If an image for mavenExecute is configured, and npm packages are to be published, the image must have npm installed.

The content of the app needs to be provided in a folder named dist in the root level of the project. Although the name of the step transportRequestUploadFile might suggest something else, in this case a folder needs to be provided. The application, which is provided in the dist folder is zipped and uploaded by the fiori toolset used for performing the upload. For CTS related uploads we use a node based toolset. When running in a docker environment a standard node image can be used. In this case the required deploy tool dependencies will be installed prior to the deploy. It is also possible to provide a docker image which already contains the required deploy tool dependencies ( config.changeManagement.cts.nodeDocker.image ). In this case an empty list needs to be provided as config.changeManagement.cts.deployToolDependencies . Using an already pre-configured docker image speeds-up the deployment step, but comes with the disadvantage of having to maintain and provision the corresponding docker image. When running in an environment without docker, it is recommanded to install the deploy tools manually on the system and to provide an empty list for the deploy tool dependencies ( config.changeManagement.cts.deployToolDependencies ).

Groovy templating for this parameter is deprecated and no longer supported. Using the runOptions parameter the 'seleniumAddress' for uiveri5 can be set. The former groovy implementation included a default for seleniumAddress in the runCommand. Since this is not possible with the golang-based implementation, the seleniumAddress has to be added to the runOptions. For jenkins on kubernetes the host is 'localhost', in other environments, e.g. native jenkins installations, the host can be set to 'selenium'. runOptions : [ \"--seleniumAddress=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub\" , ..... ] The parameter failOnError is no longer supported on the step due to strategic reasons of pipeline resilience. To achieve the former behaviour with failOnError: false configured, the step can be wrapped using try/catch in your custom pipeline script.

If you see an error like fatal: Not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /home/jenkins) it is likely that your test description cannot be found.

UIVeri5 includes features to automatically perform the login with credentials in the conf.js . However, having credentials to the acceptance system stored in plain text is not an optimal solution. Therefore, UIVeri5 allows templating to set parameters at runtime, as shown in the following example conf.js : // Read environment variables const defaultParams = { url : process . env . TARGET_SERVER_URL , user : process . env . TEST_USER , pass : process . env . TEST_PASS }; // Resolve path to specs relative to the working directory const path = require ( 'path' ); const specs = path . relative ( process . cwd (), path . join ( __dirname , '*.spec.js' )); // export UIVeri5 config exports . config = { profile : 'integration' , baseUrl : '\\${params.url}' , specs : specs , params : defaultParams , // can be overridden via cli `--params.<key>=<value>` auth : { // set up authorization for CF XSUAA 'sapcloud-form' : { user : '\\${params.user}' , pass : '\\${params.pass}' , userFieldSelector : 'input[name=\"username\"]' , passFieldSelector : 'input[name=\"password\"]' , logonButtonSelector : 'input[type=\"submit\"]' , redirectUrl : /cp.portal\\/site/ } } }; While default values for baseUrl , user and pass are read from the environment, they can also be overridden when calling the CLI. In a custom Pipeline, this is very simple: Just wrap the call to uiVeri5ExecuteTests in withCredentials ( TARGET_SERVER_URL is read from config.yml ): withCredentials ([ usernamePassword ( credentialsId: 'MY_ACCEPTANCE_CREDENTIALS' , passwordVariable: 'password' , usernameVariable: 'username' )]) { uiVeri5ExecuteTests script: this , runOptions: [ \"./uiveri5/conf.js\" , \"--params.user=\\${username}\" , \"--params.pass=\\${password}\" ] } In a Pipeline Template, a Stage Exit can be used to fetch the credentials and store them in the environment. As the environment is passed down to uiVeri5ExecuteTests, the variables will be present there. This is an example for the stage exit .pipeline/extensions/Acceptance.groovy where the credentialsId is read from the config.yml : void call ( Map params ) { // read username and password from the credential store withCredentials ([ usernamePassword ( credentialsId: params . config . acceptanceCredentialsId , passwordVariable: 'password' , usernameVariable: 'username' )]) { // store the result in the environment variables for executeUIVeri5Test withEnv ([ \"TEST_USER=\\${username}\" , \"TEST_PASS=\\${password}\" ]) { //execute original stage as defined in the template params . originalStage () } } } return this","title":"uiVeri5ExecuteTests"},{"location":"steps/uiVeri5ExecuteTests/#uiveri5executetests","text":"Executes UI5 e2e tests using uiVeri5 Deprecation notice Details of changes after the step migrated to a golang based step can be found below .","title":"uiVeri5ExecuteTests"},{"location":"steps/uiVeri5ExecuteTests/#description","text":"In this step the ( UIVeri5 tests ) are executed.","title":"Description"},{"location":"steps/uiVeri5ExecuteTests/#usage","text":"We recommend to define values of step parameters via config.yml file .
